            flag (?i) so 'Run' or 'RUN' also match. Word boundaries \b work well with

            considered a non-word character, so ''big-hat'' matched \bhat\b incorrectly
            because \b treats ''-'' as a boundary, but in this context, ''hat'' is
            part of a hyphenated word and should not match.


            To prevent matching ''hat'' when it occurs as part of hyphenated words,
            we need to ensure that the characters before and after ''run'' or ''hat''
            are not word characters (letters, digits, underscore). That means the

            a non-word character ([^\w]). This approach treats hyphens as part of
            a word, disallowing ''hat'' to match when preceded or followed by a hyphen.

            ''run'' or ''hat''. The key is to match ''run'' or ''hat'' when they are
            standalone, i.e., not part of other words.


            Step 2: Previously, we used \b word boundaries, but the issue arises due
            to the treatment of hyphens. In many regex engines, word boundaries consider
            hyphens as boundaries, meaning ''run-hat'' would incorrectly match both
            ''run'' and ''hat'' as standalone words.


            Step 3: The user points out ''run-hat race'' should NOT match since ''run''
            and ''hat'' are connected by a hyphen and are not truly standalone.


            Step 4: Therefore, we need more precise boundaries than \b. We want to
            ensure that the character before ''run'' or ''hat'' is either the start
            of line or a non-alphanumeric character (excluding underscore), and the
            character after is the end of line or a non-alphanumeric character (excluding
            underscore). But to exclude hyphen as a delimiter (i.e., hyphen connects
            the words, not a separator), we''ll exclude hyphen from valid boundary
            characters.


            Step 5: Use negative lookbehind and lookahead to check that the character
            before is not an alphanumeric character (A-Za-z0-9), and the character
            after is not alphanumeric. This excludes underscores and hyphens.


            Step 6: This pattern: (?<![A-Za-z0-9])(?:run|hat)(?![A-Za-z0-9]) matches
            ''run'' or ''hat'' when not preceded or followed by alphanumeric characters.


            Step 7: Wrapping in a lookahead and full line anchors: ^(?=.*(?<![A-Za-z0-9])(?:run|hat)(?![A-Za-z0-9])).*$


            This way, ''run-hat race'' does not match since the ''run'' is followed
            immediately by hyphen (which is not alphanumeric, so might still pass),
            but since hyphen is not alphanumeric, it might still match. However, the
            user wants ''run-hat'' not to count as standalone words.


            Step 8: To solve this, we should exclude hyphen explicitly. So treat hyphen
            as part of word characters. So we adjust the negative lookbehind/lookahead

            words, not as substrings of other words.

            2. Using word boundaries ''\b'' ensures that ''run'' or ''hat'' is matched
            only when it appears as a whole word. This correctly matches words adjacent
            to punctuation (e.g., ''run,'' or ''hat.'') because ''\b'' matches transitions
            between word characters and non-word characters.

            3. The regex is simply ''\b(run|hat)\b'' without anchors (e.g., ''^''
            or ''$'') since many line-by-line searching tools (like grep) don''t require
            full-line anchors when matching lines containing a pattern.

            4. There are no capturing groups needed; the parentheses are for grouping
            alternation only.

            5. Case sensitivity is often important; typically, matching should be
            case-insensitive to capture variations like ''Run'' or ''HAT''. To do
            this, use the appropriate case-insensitive flag depending on the tool
            (e.g., ''i'' flag in many regex engines).

            6. Escaping is provided as a standard literal regex pattern; in languages
            requiring string escaping (like Python or JavaScript), backslash signs
            will need double escaping (e.g., "\\b"), but here we provide the raw regex
            pattern itself.


            Example test cases:

            - "I like to run every morning." -> matches ''run''

            - "She wears a hat." -> matches ''hat''

            - "Running is fun." -> no match (because ''run'' is part of ''Running'')

            - "That hat is nice." -> matches ''hat'' (not ''that'')

            - "Run, don''t walk." -> matches ''Run'' with case-insensitive flag

            Step 2: To match standalone words only, use the word boundary token ''\b''

            that 'hero' is matched as a standalone word and not as part of another
            word like 'heroes' or 'heron'. The pattern '^.*' and '.*$' allow for any

            \n1. **Word Definition**: We want words consisting only of alphabetic\
            \ letters (a-z, A-Z). Hence, replace `\\w` with `[a-zA-Z]`.\n\n2. **Word\
            \ Length**: Words must have at least one letter before the ending 'y'\
            \ or 'i', so use `[a-zA-Z]+[yiYI]` to ensure a minimum length of two characters\
            \ (e.g. \"my\", \"Ki\"). This avoids matching zero-length strings before\
            \ the ending letter.\n\n3. **Word Boundaries**: Use `\\b` at the end only\
            \ to assert the end of the word after the last letter. No need at the\
            \ start since `[a-zA-Z]+` anchors the start of the word.\n\n4. **Case-insensitive\
            \ Ending**: Allow both uppercase and lowercase 'y' or 'i' by including\
            \ `[yiYI]` in the regex.\n\n5. **Whitespace Separation**: Words can be\
            \ separated by one or more whitespace characters (`\\s+`), which includes\
            \ spaces, tabs, and more.\n\n6. **No Trailing Whitespace**: Enforce that\
            \ the last word is immediately followed by end-of-line `$`, ensuring no\
            \ trailing whitespace.\n\n7. **Whole Line Matching**: The regex starts\
            \ with `^` and ends with `$` to match an entire line.\n\n8. **Repeat for\
            \ Multiple Words**: Use a non-capturing group `(?: ... )+` to match one\
            \ or more words, each followed by either whitespace or the end of line.\n\

            \ Hippy KIMI` (mixed case endings)\n- Does not match:\n  - `happy kiwi\
            \ ` (trailing space)\n  - `happy kiwi1` (word ending with digit)\n  -\
            \ `happy, kiwi` (comma included)\n  - Empty line\n\nThis refined regex\
            \ correctly matches lines where every word ends with 'y' or 'i', words\

          reasoning: 'To refine the regex based on the feedback and address the issues
            step-by-step:


            1. **Restrict to letters only:** Instead of \w which includes digits and
            underscores, use [a-zA-Z] to allow only alphabetic characters.


            2. **Ensure words end with ''y'' or ''i'':** Each word is at least one
            letter, ending with either ''y'' or ''i'', represented as [a-zA-Z]*[yi].
            Here, "*" allows for words with one or more letters (e.g., ''y'' alone
            counts as a single-letter word ending in ''y'').


            3. **Word separation:** Words must be separated by at least one whitespace
            character, so use \s+ between words to avoid matching concatenated words
            without spaces. This also correctly handles tabs and multiple spaces.


            4. **Line anchors:** Use ^ and $ to ensure the pattern matches the whole
            line.


            5. **Allow trailing whitespace handling implicitly:** The last word is
            followed by end of line ($), not necessarily whitespace.


            6. **No punctuation allowed:** Since only letters are matched in words,
            punctuation adjacent to words will cause the line not to match.


            7. **Grouping:** The non-capturing group (?:...) allows matching one or
            more words with the required pattern.


            This refined regex ensures only lines composed entirely of words made
            from letters ending in ''y'' or ''i'', separated by spaces (or other whitespace),
            are matched fully from start to end with no extraneous characters.'

            \ words as sequences of alphabetic characters only (no digits or underscores).\n\
            \nStep-by-step refinement:\n\n1. **Definition of 'word':** To avoid matching\
            \ undesired characters such as digits and underscores, the internal word\
            \ characters are restricted to alphabetic letters `[a-z]+`. This ensures\
            \ we match words consisting only of letters.\n\n2. **Ending characters:**\
            \ The last character of the word is explicitly matched as \"[yi]\", and\
            \ together with case-insensitive matching (enabled via `(?i)`), it captures\
            \ 'y', 'Y', 'i', or 'I'.\n\n3. **Word boundary:** `\\b` is used after\
            \ `[yi]` to ensure the matched sequence ends at a word boundary, preventing\
            \ the match of partial words.\n\n4. **Full line matching:** The regex\
            \ uses `^` and `$` anchors to match entire lines.\n\n5. **Case insensitivity:**\
            \ The inline modifier `(?i)` makes the whole pattern case-insensitive,\
            \ which handles uppercase 'Y'/'I' without needing to explicitly add uppercase\
            \ letters in the character class.\n\n6. **Simplicity and efficiency:**\
            \ Instead of using a lookahead, the pattern simply matches any characters\
            \ (`.*`) before and after the word pattern, achieving readability and\
            \ simplicity. This avoids scanning the line twice.\n\n**Final regex:**\

            \ day\" (matches 'Happy')\n  - \"Origami is fun\" (matches 'Origami')\n\
            \  - \"Party tonight\" (matches 'Party')\n  - \"Sushi and Pastry\" (matches\
            \ 'Sushi' and 'Pastry')\n- Does not match:\n  - \"abc123\" (digits present,\
            \ no word ending in 'y' or 'i')\n  - \"Test_line\" (underscore inside\
            \ word)\n  - \"Try!\" if 'Try!' is considered a word without the exclamation\
            \ mark, 'Try' ends with 'y' so line matches\n\nThis solution ensures only\
            \ alphabetic words ending in 'y' or 'i' (case-insensitive) are considered,\

          reasoning: 'The task is to find lines containing words ending with ''y''
            or ''i'', where words consist only of alphabetic characters (no digits
            or underscores). The previous regex used ''\w*'', which incorrectly matches
            digits and underscores, and allowed zero characters before the final letter,
            enabling single-letter words like ''y'' or ''i'' to match, which may or
            may not be intended.


            Improvements made:

            1. Replace ''\w*'' with ''[a-zA-Z]*'' to restrict the word characters
            to only letters.

            2. Remove the anchors ''^'' and ''$'' to allow matching the presence of
            such words anywhere within the line, since matching the entire line is
            unnecessary.

            3. Use word boundaries ''\b'' to ensure full word matches, properly handling
            punctuation adjacent to words (e.g., ''happy,'' or ''ski!'').


            This regex will find any occurrence of a word made up solely of letters,
            ending with ''y'' or ''i'' in a line. It accepts words of length at least
            one (including ''y'' or ''i'' alone), and handles punctuation and adjacent
            non-word characters correctly.


            If Unicode letters need to be supported, a Unicode property class like
            ''\p{L}'' could replace ''[a-zA-Z]'', but that depends on regex engine
            support."'

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Clarify the intention to match lines containing words
            ending specifically with ''y'' or ''i'', considering both lowercase and
            uppercase letters.

            Step 2: Decide that single-letter words ''y'' or ''i'' should not be matched
            based on typical word usage, thus requiring at least one character before
            the final letter.

            Step 3: Replace ''\w'' with ''[a-zA-Z]'' to restrict word characters to
            alphabetic letters only, excluding digits and underscores.

            Step 4: Use ''\b[a-zA-Z]+[yiYI]\b'' to match words of at least two alphabetic
            characters ending with ''y'' or ''i'' in any case.

            Step 5: Employ a positive lookahead ''(?=.*\b[a-zA-Z]+[yiYI]\b)'' to assert
            the presence of such a word anywhere in the line.

            Step 6: Anchor the regex with ''^'' and ''$'' and match the full line
            with ''.*'' to ensure the pattern applies to the entire line.

            Step 7: Reasoning includes acknowledgment of case sensitivity by including
            both uppercase and lowercase endings and exclusion of digits/underscores,
            improving accuracy.

            The final regex effectively matches any line containing at least one alphabetic
