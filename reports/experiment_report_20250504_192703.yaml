          reasoning: We need to match lines that contain at least one sequence of
            exactly 6 consecutive letters (a-z or A-Z), and not a longer sequence
            (like 7 or more letters). To ensure this, we use a positive lookahead
            `(?=.*[a-zA-Z]{6})` to assert that there is at least one occurrence of
            6 letters consecutively somewhere in the line. However, lines with sequences
            longer than 6 letters (like 7 or more letters) should not match. To exclude
            those, we add a negative lookahead `(?!.*[a-zA-Z]{7})` asserting that
            there is no sequence of 7 or more letters consecutively. Anchoring with
            `^` and `$` makes sure we match the entire line. Therefore, the regex
            matches a full line only if there exists at least one 6-letter consecutive
            sequence and no sequences longer than 6 letters.

            letters, with the character before and after (if any) not being a letter,
            or at the start/end of line.


            Step 4: Construct regex:

            - Use ''^'' and ''$'' to match the entire line.

            - ''.*'' matches any characters before the target sequence.

            - ''[^A-Za-z]?'' matches zero or one non-letter character before the 6
            letters - covers start of line (no character) or non-letter.

            - ''[A-Za-z]{6}'' matches exactly 6 letters.

            - ''[^A-Za-z]?'' matches zero or one non-letter character after the letters
            - covers end of line or non-letter.

            - ''.*'' matches any characters after that.

            sequences).


            Alternative to ''[^A-Za-z]?'' is using word boundaries ''\b'', but that
            might consider digits or underscores as boundaries. Using explicit checks

            1. We want to match an entire line, so we use start (^) and end ($) anchors.

            2. Inside the line, somewhere, there must be a substring where ''din''
            follows either ''e'' or ''ky''. This means the substring could be ''edin''
            or ''kydin''.

            3. To represent either ''e'' or ''ky'' before ''din'', we use a non-capturing
            group: (?:e|ky)

            4. Following it is ''din'' literally.

            5. There could be any characters before this substring and after it, so
            we allow ''.*'' before and after.

            6. Putting it together: ^.*(?:e|ky)din.*$

            7. Wrap the inside with a non-capturing group and match the entire line.


            Thus, the final regex is ^.*(?:e|ky)din.*$ which will match lines containing

            we use a lookahead to assert the presence of this pattern: (?=.*(?:e|ky)din)

            - A ''word'' generally means a sequence of word characters \w+ (letters,

            - ''Starting with fa'' means the first two letters are ''fa''. So the

            at least one word starting with ''fa'', we can wrap it with ^.* at start

            - (?=.*\b10\b) ensures ''10'' is somewhere in the line.


            Step 4: The regex should match the whole line, so we start with ^ and
            end with $.


            Step 5: The .* after the lookaheads consumes the entire line.


            Thus, the final regex is:

            ''10'', not as parts of other numbers or words.

            2. Use positive lookaheads (?=.*\b9\b) and (?=.*\b10\b) to ensure both

            3. The anchors ^ and $ ensure the regex matches the entire line.

            Step 3: The regex should match the full line.


            To achieve this:

            - Use ''^'' and ''$'' to match the start and end of the line.

            - Between ''^'' and ''email'', use ''.*'' to allow any characters before

            Step 3: Since regexes normally don''t capture order with two separate

            anything, then ''spam'', or use lookaheads carefully.


            Step 4: Combining them, we can use a lookahead for ''email'' first: (?=.*\bemail\b)

            digits like "notebook123" because the word boundary \b checks for non-word
            characters or string boundaries, and digits are word characters.


            Step 2: Since "notebook123" should match (a word starting with "no", followed
            by letters, and possibly digits after that), we must clarify the requirement:
            The word must begin with "no", then have one or more letters, and can
            optionally continue with digits after those letters.


            Step 3: Therefore, the pattern should match a whole word starting with
            "no", followed by one or more letters, and then optionally digits. The
            pattern for such a word is:


            \bno[a-zA-Z]+\d*\b


            - \b ensures word boundaries

            - no literal

            - [a-zA-Z]+ followed by one or more letters

            - \d* followed by zero or more digits


            Step 4: The regex must match lines containing one or more such words,
            so we use a positive lookahead to verify the presence of such words:


            ^(?=.*\bno[a-zA-Z]+\d*\b).*$


            This matches the entire line, asserting that somewhere in the line there''s
            a word matching the pattern.


            Step 5: This approach correctly matches "notebook123" since the word starts
            with "no", followed by letters, and digits, satisfying the inclusion requirement.

            To fix this:

            In the provided edge case, words are separated by irregular spacing including

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. The requirement is to match lines with at least two occurrences of
            the letter ''z''. The user example suggests the letter ''z'' should be
            matched in a case-insensitive manner.

            2. To handle this, we add the inline modifier `(?i)` at the start of the
            regex to make the entire regex case-insensitive.

            3. The pattern `(?:[^z]*z){2}` means: find any number of characters that
            are not ''z'' (case-insensitive because of `(?i)`), then one ''z'', repeated
            twice.

            4. The rest of the line is matched with `.*` and anchors `^` and `$` ensure
            matching the full line.


            Thus, the final regex `^(?i)(?:[^z]*z){2}.*$` will match lines containing
            at least two letters ''z'' or ''Z'', anywhere in the line.'

            \ Two 'z's lowercase (last two). So it SHOULD match if matching lowercase\

            Step 4: To ensure we don''t cross lines (if input has multiple lines),

            If the user considers ''y'' and ''e'' not vowels for this task or has
            some other criteria, it would need clarification. Assuming standard vowels
            (a, e, i, o, u) and case-insensitive matching, ''blue'' ends with ''e''
            which is a vowel, so the regex should match.


            Since the problem requires matching lines with words ending with vowels
            only, and this regex does that correctly, no change is needed.


            To ensure correct operation:

            - The regex uses word boundaries to isolate words.

            - It looks for any word \w* ending with [aeiouAEIOU].

            - This prevents false matches on parts of words.


            Therefore, the regex is appropriate and correctly handles lines without
            words ending with vowels by not matching them.'

            with ''o'', including ''Hello'' because it ends with lowercase ''o''.
            The user states ''Hello'' should not match. Since their explanation indicates
            that the problem is case sensitivity only on the last character (which
            is lowercase ''o'' in ''Hello''), the discrepancy is likely due to misunderstanding.
            ''Hello'' ends with a lowercase ''o'' and should match per the original
            problem description (''lines that end in an ''o''''). Thus, ''Hello''
            should match since the last character is ''o'', which is lowercase. The
            user says ''Hello'' should not match, but their explanation references
            uppercase ''H'' at the start and the lowercase ''o'' at the end, and they
            do not want to match unless specified otherwise. However, the original
            instructions just want to match lines ending in ''o'', with no case conditions
            on the start. Therefore, the original regex is correct for this interpretation.


            Given that, ''hello!'' does not end with ''o'' and won''t match, and ''o''
            is a single character line ending with ''o'' and will match. Therefore,
            the initial regex ''^.*o$'' satisfies the conditions for matching lines
            ending in ''o''. There''s no need to change it unless the user wants to
            exclude words like ''Hello''. Since excluding ''Hello'' means ignoring
            case for the last letter ''o'', we can enforce the last character to be
            lowercase ''o'' only.


            Conclusion: The regex ''^.*o$'' correctly matches lines that end with
            a lowercase ''o'' only. It matches ''hello'' and ''o'' and does not match
            ''hello!''. It also matches ''Hello'' because ''Hello'' ends with lowercase
            ''o''. The user''s expectation that ''Hello'' should not match contradicts
            the problem statement. If the intention is to exclude lines that start
            with uppercase and match only lines starting lowercase or lines ending
            lowercase ''o'' only, more specification is needed.


            Without conflicting instructions, the simplest solution ''^.*o$'' is correct
            as it matches full lines ending with ''o''. Therefore, I will keep the

            Step 2: To include ''emailspam'' as a single word match, we add an alternative

            Step 5: Since order matters, the pattern enforces ''email'' before ''spam''.

            Step 3: To enforce ordering, we specifically look for ''email'' first

            does not count as ''email'' as a whole word, so to match ''email123'',
            if the user wants that, a different strategy would be needed; but per
            the clarification, ''email'' must be matched as a standalone word).


            Therefore, this regex satisfies the requirements, including the edge cases

            Also, the regex must enforce that ''spam'' appears after ''email'' in
            the line (order matters).


            Step 1: ''email'' may appear as a substring (no word boundary), so use
            ''email'' directly.

            Step 2: After matching ''email'', the remaining characters (.*) can be

            in ''email123'', and ''spam'' is in ''spammy'' later.

            - ''spam email is annoying'' does NOT match since ''spam'' appears before
            ''email''.


            Thus, the regex correctly handles the order and partial matches as required.'

            before ''email'' should NOT match. Hence, we must ensure ''email'' happens
            first, then ''spam'' later in the line.


            Step 2: The previous solution used word boundaries for ''email'' and ''spam''
            to match as whole words. However, the second edge case states that ''emailspam''
            as a single concatenated word should also match, i.e., ''email'' immediately
            followed by ''spam'' with no separator.


            Step 3: To account for this, we add an alternation in the lookahead: either
            ''emailspam'' occurs anywhere, or the word ''email'' (bounded) occurs,
            followed somewhere later by ''spam'' (not necessarily bounded as per problem).


            Step 4: Use a positive lookahead to match if either ''emailspam'' is found,
            or if ''email'' as a whole word is found followed later by ''spam''.


            Step 5: The regex is anchored to the start and end to match the whole
            line.


            Thus, the regex is:

            This matches lines that contain ''emailspam'' anywhere, or contain ''email''
            as a whole word followed later by ''spam'' anywhere, ensuring order is

            5. The user says: "Only two words start with ''s'', but ''sleeps'' contains
            an ''s'' not at the beginning; highlights the importance of starting letter
            detection only."

            6. That is contradictory. ''sleeps'' does start with ''s''; so both words
            ''sheep'' and ''sleeps'' start with ''s''.

            7. Possibly, the user means that although two words start with ''s'',
            the presence of ''s'' in the middle of words mistakenly allowed other
            words to count.

            8. But the original regex counts words starting with ''s'' only.

            9. So the previous regex is correct for this input: ''sheep sleeps alone''
            - it will match correctly since ''sheep'' and ''sleeps'' both start with
            ''s''.

            10. Since user wants this NOT to match, probably because the words share
            the same root or the user wants two different distinct words starting
            with ''s''? That''s ambiguous.

            11. Given the user emphasizes about "starting letter detection only" and
            ignoring ''s'' in the middle, the previous regex does exactly that: it
            matches words starting with ''s'', doesn''t count inner ''s''.

            12. Possibly the user wants lines that have at least two different words
            that start with ''s''?

            13. The example ''sheep sleeps alone'' contains ''sheep'' and ''sleeps''
            both starting with ''s'' but the user says ''should not match''. This
            conflicts with the problem.


            Given the contradiction, the best interpretation is:

            - The user wants at least two words that start with distinct letters,
            both starting with ''s'' and be strictly full words.\n- Need to explicitly
            match words starting with ''s'' or ''S''.


            Hence, the previous regex is correct and does exactly this. The example
            given is contradictory.


            Therefore the best regex remains: ^(?=.*\b[sS][a-zA-Z]*\b.*\b[sS][a-zA-Z]*\b).*$


            No change is needed. Possibly user misunderstood the example.


            If the user wants at least two words starting with ''s'' but not the same

            modifier (?i) at the start to enable case-insensitive matching so that
            words starting with both 's' and 'S' are matched. The rest of the regex
            remains the same, matching at least two words starting with 's' or 'S'

            letters, not part of a longer sequence of letters.


            Issues with the previous solution:

            - It matches sequences of six or more letters since it doesn''t ensure
            the sequence isn''t part of a longer sequence.

            - It uses unnecessary anchors ''^'' and ''$'' which are not required when
            searching within a line.


            Improvement approach:

            - Use negative lookbehind ''(?<![a-zA-Z])'' to assert that the character
            before the 6-letter sequence is not a letter (or is start of string).

            - Use negative lookahead ''(?![a-zA-Z])'' to assert that the character
            after the 6-letter sequence is not a letter (or is end of string).

            - Include both uppercase and lowercase letters via character class ''[a-zA-Z]''.


            This ensures the matched sequence is exactly six letters, neither preceded
            nor followed by additional letters, effectively preventing matching substrings
            of longer letter sequences.


            Example test cases:

            - "abcdef" -> matches exactly 6 letters.

            - "abc def" -> matches ''abcdef'' does not exist; individual ''abc'' and
            ''def'' are less than 6 letters, so no match.

            - "abcdefg" -> no match because sequence length is 7.

            - "123abcDEF456" -> matches ''abcDEF'' (exactly 6 letters).


            Thus, the final regex ''(?<![a-zA-Z])[a-zA-Z]{6}(?![a-zA-Z])'' accurately
            matches a sequence of exactly six consecutive letters within a line.'

            Improved approach:

            - Removed ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' as they are redundant when searching for
            a pattern anywhere in the line.

            - Use negative lookbehind ''(?<![A-Za-z])'' to ensure the 6-letter sequence
            is not immediately preceded by a letter, correctly handling sequences
            at the start of the line where no character exists before.

            - Use negative lookahead ''(?![A-Za-z])'' to ensure the 6-letter sequence
            is not immediately followed by a letter, allowing sequences at the end
            of the line.

            - The ASCII letter range ''[A-Za-z]'' is used since Unicode support depends
            on the regex engine. If the engine supports Unicode properties (e.g.,
            \p{L}), replacing ''[A-Za-z]'' with ''\p{L}'' would be better for international
            characters.

            - Word boundaries ''\b'' could be an alternative, but they detect word
            characters which include digits and underscores, so using explicit lookarounds
            is more precise for letters only.


            This regex will thus detect any substring of exactly 6 consecutive ASCII

            Step 2: To ensure we only match the standalone word ''code'' and not substrings
            like ''decode'' or ''codex'', we use word boundaries ''\b'' around ''code''.
            This makes sure the match occurs when ''code'' is surrounded by non-word

            Step 3: The regex ''\bcode\b'' can be used with Python''s ''re.search''

            Step 3: Since the word must have at least one letter before ''y'', we

            for punctuation adjacency.


            Step 4: Ensure minimum word length:

            - Use \w+ before ''y'' to ensure the word has at least one character before
            ''y'' (i.e., exclude single-letter ''y'' word).

            and supports Unicode word characters depending on the environment. The
            pattern is anchored with '^' and '$' and includes '.*' before and after
            to allow any content around the target word. The '(?i)' inline modifier
            at the start provides case-insensitive matching, so words like 'No', 'NO',
            'nO' will also be matched. This satisfies the requirement efficiently

            Step 1: We want to ensure that ''e'' appears somewhere before ''din''
            OR ''ky'' appears somewhere before ''din'' in the line.


            Step 2: Use lookahead assertions that check the presence of ''e'' followed
            by ''din'' anywhere after it: ''.*e.*din'', or of ''ky'' followed by ''din'':
            ''.*ky.*din''.


            Step 3: Combine these two conditions with an OR: ''.*e.*din|.*ky.*din''.


            Step 4: Use a lookahead at the start of the line to assert the condition:

            Step 2: The pattern ''(?:e|ky)din'' directly matches ''din'' preceded
            by either ''e'' or ''ky''. This ensures that ''din'' isn''t preceded by
            other characters.


            Step 3: Since the sequence can appear anywhere in the line, we allow any
            characters before and after the sequence with ''.*''. This lets the regex
            match the entire line if it contains the target sequence.


            Step 4: Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are unnecessary if the line is tested

            case-insensitive (e.g., matching ''Edin'', ''KYdin'', etc.) unless case
            sensitivity is explicitly preferred.

            - In Python, ''^'' and ''$'' anchor start and end of line respectively

            - This regex assumes lines are separated properly; if matching over multiple
            lines, appropriate flags or processing may be required.


            Examples:

            Step 2: To ensure ''the'' is matched as a standalone word, we use the
            word boundary anchor ''\b'' immediately after ''the''. This ensures that
            ''the'' is followed by a non-word character or end of the line.

            1. ''^'' asserts the start of the line.

            2. ''the'' matches the literal sequence of characters ''t'', ''h'', ''e''
            in lowercase only. This is deliberate to ensure case sensitivity.

            3. ''\b'' is a word boundary to ensure ''the'' is matched as a whole word,
            not as part of a longer word like ''there'' or ''then''. For example,
            lines starting with ''there'' will not match.

            4. ''.*'' matches zero or more of any characters (except newline), allowing
            any text or none after ''the''. This covers lines that just contain ''the''
            alone as well as lines where ''the'' is followed by spaces, punctuation,
            or other words.

            5. ''$'' asserts the end of the line.

            Note: The regex does not allow leading whitespace before ''the''. If lines
            with leading spaces should be matched, the regex would need to be adjusted
            accordingly (e.g., ''^[ \t]*the\b.*$'').'

            2. Literal ''the'': Matches exactly the lowercase word ''the''.

            3. Word boundary (\b): Added immediately after ''the'' to ensure ''the''
            is not part of a larger word (e.g., not ''then'' or ''theremin''). This
            means ''the'' must be followed by a non-word character, such as space,
            punctuation, or end of line.

            4. ''.*'': Matches any characters (zero or more), representing any text

            implies their presence.

            2. Simplified to a single positive lookahead that checks for either ''Stacks''
            before ''Jim'' before ''Slim'' or ''Slim'' before ''Jim'' before ''Stacks''.

            3. Added the inline case-insensitive flag `(?i)` at the start to handle
            case-insensitive matching.

            4. Kept word boundaries (`\b`) to avoid matching substrings within other

            6. Removed the redundant `.*$` inside the pattern since line start and

            Although this regex uses lookaheads, it is less complex and more performant

            all cases with multiple occurrences of words in different orders, this
            provides a practical balance of correctness and efficiency given the original
            problem constraints.'

            "Stacks", "Jim", and "Slim", with "Jim" located between "Stacks" and "Slim"
            in either order. The line should match if either sequence "Stacks ...
            Jim ... Slim" or "Slim ... Jim ... Stacks" appears.


            Step 2: To ensure the words are whole words and not substrings, the word
            boundary \b is used around each keyword.


            Step 3: Instead of using multiple redundant lookaheads, we merge the ordering
            requirement into a single positive lookahead that checks for either valid
            sequence. This simplifies the regex and improves readability and efficiency.


            Step 4: The lookahead `(?=.*\b(?:Stacks\b.*\bJim\b.*\bSlim|Slim\b.*\bJim\b.*\bStacks)\b)`
            asserts that somewhere in the line, either "Stacks" is followed by "Jim",
            which is followed by "Slim", or "Slim" is followed by "Jim", which is
            followed by "Stacks".

            \ clarify the requirements and reasoning:\n\n1. **Definition of 'Jim'\
            \ in between 'Stacks' and 'Slim'**:\n   'Jim' must appear after one of\
            \ the words ('Stacks' or 'Slim') and before the other. There can be arbitrary\
            \ text between these words, but the order must be either:\n   - 'Stacks'\

            \ Multiple Occurrences**:\n   The regex should confirm that *the first\
            \ time 'Stacks' occurs before 'Jim' and 'Jim' before 'Slim'* (or vice\
            \ versa). To simplify, we look for at least one sequence matching this\
            \ order and exclude sequences where 'Jim' appears outside of that order.\n\
            \n3. **Case Sensitivity**:\n   Since the problem does not specify case-insensitivity,\
            \ we keep the match case-sensitive but this can be adjusted with inline\
            \ flag `(?i)` if needed.\n\n4. **Redundancy and Performance**:\n   - Remove\
            \ the initial positive lookaheads because the lookaheads combined with\
            \ alternation are redundant.\n   - Alternatively, to ensure 'Jim' is strictly\
            \ between 'Stacks' and 'Slim' with correct order, use positive lookaheads\
            \ that express this order explicitly.\n\n5. **Regex Explanation**:\n\n\
            The improved regex uses two patterns separated by alternation `|`:\n\n\
            - `^(?=.*\\bStacks\\b.*\\bJim\\b.*\\bSlim\\b)(?!.*\\bStacks\\b.*\\bSlim\\\
            b.*\\bJim\\b)(?:.*)$`\n  * This means:\n    - Positive lookahead: There\
            \ exists 'Stacks' then 'Jim' then 'Slim' (in that order) somewhere in\
            \ the line.\n    - Negative lookahead: No occurrence of 'Stacks' then\
            \ 'Slim' then 'Jim' (which would contradict 'Jim' being in between).\n\
            \    - `(?:.*)$` matches the whole line (although the lookaheads already\
            \ ensure pattern).\n\n- `^(?=.*\\bSlim\\b.*\\bJim\\b.*\\bStacks\\b)(?!.*\\\
            bSlim\\b.*\\bStacks\\b.*\\bJim\\b)(?:.*)$`\n  * Similarly for the reverse\
            \ order.\n\nThis approach allows lines where 'Jim' is between 'Stacks'\
            \ and 'Slim' in either order, and reduces false positives where 'Jim'\
            \ appears outside.\n\n6. **Word Boundaries**:\n   They are retained to\
            \ ensure exact word matching.\n\n7. **Anchors**:\n   Since we use lookaheads\
            \ over the entire line, using `^` and `$` helps to anchor the match to\
            \ the full line.\n\n**Note:**\n- Depending on the regex engine, escaping\
            \ backslashes varies: in Python string literals, `\\b` is used to represent\
            \ regex `\\b`.\n- For case-insensitive matching, add `(?i)` at the start.\n\
            \n**Example confirming correctness:**\n- Matches:\n  - \"There is Stacks\
            \ before Jim and then Slim.\"\n  - \"Slim appears first, then Jim, then\
            \ Stacks.\"\n- Does not match:\n  - \"Jim comes before both Stacks and\
            \ Slim.\"\n  - \"Stacks and Slim are mentioned, but Jim is after both.\"\

            ''\w*'' matches zero or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscore),
            and the final ''\b'' denotes the end of the word.

            and ''$'' at the end to ensure full-line matching.

            Step 4: ''.*'' before and after the word pattern allows for any characters

            This solves issues of allowing only letters in words, enforcing whitespace
            separation, and avoiding allowing digits/underscores/punctuation as word
            separators.'

            these digits, which could incorrectly match lines where ''4'' is not strictly

            To refine this:

            - We interpret "between" as ''4'' appearing somewhere after a ''3'' and
            before a ''5'' without other ''3'' or ''5'' digits interrupting that sequence.

            - So between ''3'' and ''4'', and between ''4'' and ''5'', no other ''3''
            or ''5'' should appear.


            Thus the pattern ''3[^35]*4[^35]*5'' is used:

            - ''3'' followed by zero or more characters that are not ''3'' or ''5''
            ([^35]*),

            - then ''4'', then again zero or more characters not ''3'' or ''5'',

            - then ''5''.


            Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' and the wrapping ''.*'' allow matching a full
            line that contains this pattern anywhere within it.


            Examples:

            This regex refines the original by enforcing that ''4'' lies strictly

            Step 1: The regex must anchor to the start and end of the line, so we
            use ''^'' at the beginning and ''$'' at the end.


            Step 2: To ensure at least two ''z'' characters, we can match any number
            of non-''z'' characters (including zero) followed by a ''z'', repeated
            at least twice. This is achieved by the group (?:[^z\n]*z){2,} where [^z\n]*
            matches any number of non-''z'' and non-newline characters, then ''z''
            matches the letter ''z''. {2,} ensures this group occurs at least twice,
            thus ensuring at least two ''z''s.


            Step 3: After the last ''z'' matched in the group, we can have zero or
            more of any characters except newline, hence [^\n]* until the end of the
            line.


            Thus, the regex ''^(?:[^z\n]*z){2,}[^\n]*$'' matches entire lines that
            contain two or more occurrences of ''z''.'
          regex: ^(?:[^z\n]*z){2,}[^\n]*$
        score: 1.0
      - output:
          reasoning: 'The problem is to match lines containing the letter ''z'' (case-insensitive)
            at least twice, meaning two or more occurrences anywhere in the line.


            Step 1: Use case-insensitive mode to match both ''z'' and ''Z''. This
            is achieved by the inline modifier `(?i)` at the start of the regex.


            Step 2: Construct a pattern to find occurrences of ''z''s preceded by
            zero or more non-''z'' characters: `[^z]*z`. Here, `[^z]*` means any number
            of characters except ''z'', followed by one ''z''.


            Step 3: To ensure at least two occurrences, repeat this group at least
            twice: `(?:[^z]*z){2,}`. The `{2,}` quantifier means two or more repetitions.


            Step 4: After these ''z''s are matched, `.*$` allows any other characters
            until the end of the line. This permits additional ''z''s or any other
            characters beyond the second ''z''.


            Step 5: Anchor the pattern with `^` and `$` to match the entire line.


            Thus, the full regex `^(?i)(?:[^z]*z){2,}.*$` matches entire lines that
            contain at least two ''z'' or ''Z'' letters anywhere in the text, including
            lines with more than two ''z''s.'

            ''An'', ''AN'').

            Step 2: Use the ''\b'' word boundary anchor to ensure the match starts
            at the beginning of a word. This prevents partial matches inside other
            words (e.g., won''t match ''banana'').

            Step 3: Match the letters ''an'' literally.

            Step 4: After ''an'', allow zero or more characters that are letters (a-z),
            apostrophes (''), or hyphens (-) by using the character class ''[a-z''-]*''.
            This expands the definition of a word to include words like "an-noying"
            or "an''s".

            Step 5: Use the trailing ''\b'' to mark the end of the word, ensuring

            1. The original regex used a repeated group with ''.*'' inside the lookahead,
            which was greedy and could cause overlapping matches and inefficiencies.
            To improve:

            - Replace ''.*'' with ''.*?'' (non-greedy) inside the repeated group to
            prevent overlapping matches and reduce backtracking.


            2. Punctuation and special characters are handled by relying on \b (word
            boundaries), which match transitions between \w (alphanumeric + underscore)
            and non-\w characters. This means words are sequences of alphanumerics
            and underscores.

            - So words adjacent to punctuation are still correctly identified.


            3. The revised lookahead ''(?=(?:.*?\b\w{4}\b){2,})'' ensures that at
            least two 4-letter words appear anywhere in the line without greedily
            consuming characters.

            - The line is matched in full.


            This approach is more efficient and less prone to unexpected overlapping
            matches while correctly handling punctuation and word boundaries.'

            1. Define a word as a sequence starting with ''s'' or ''S'' followed by
            word characters, apostrophes or hyphens, e.g., [Ss][\w''-]+.

            2. Use explicit non-word separators to ensure words are properly bounded:
            [^\w''-]+ (i.e., at least one character that is not word char, apostrophe
            or hyphen) between words.

            3. The regex matches lines where the pattern (separator + s-word) occurs
            at least two times.


            Detailed explanation:

            - ^(?:[^\w''-]*[Ss][\w''-]+[^\w''-]+){1,}[Ss][\w''-]+: from line start,
            allow optional leading non-word chars, then one or more occurrences of
            a word starting with s followed by separator, then one last s-word.

            - (?:[^\w''-]+.*)?$ allows for optional trailing separator and remaining
            characters until line end.


            This ensures at least two words starting with ''s''/ ''S'' separated by
            valid boundaries.


            Examples:

            - Matches "Sunshine and sister-in-law" (two s-words: Sunshine, sister-in-law)

            1. Using ''\b'' at both ends ensures that the pattern matches whole words

            (alphanumeric or underscore) and a non-word character (like space, punctuation,
            or start/end of line).


            2. Inside the word, ''[\w''-]*'' matches zero or more word characters
            (letters, digits, underscore), apostrophes, or hyphens. This allows matching
            words like "college", "edge", as well as hyphenated or contracted words
            like "pre-stage" or "can''t" if they ended with ''ge''. This broadens

            Step 3: To restrict to alphabetic words only, replace ''\w'' with ''[a-zA-Z]''

          reasoning: 'The original regex ''^.*(?:ead|pro).*$'' matches any line containing
            ''ead'' or ''pro'' anywhere, but it''s unnecessarily verbose with the
            start ''^.*'' and end ''.*$'' anchors and quantifiers.


            Since the goal is to match lines containing these substrings anywhere,
            the simpler regex ''(?:ead|pro)'' suffices. Regex search without anchors
            already finds substrings anywhere in the line.


            This simplified regex is more efficient as it avoids redundant scanning.


            Also, the regex matches ''ead'' or ''pro'' exactly as is, respecting case
            sensitivity. If case-insensitive matching is desired, the regex engine''s
            case-insensitive flag should be used instead of inline modifiers.


            Edge cases such as substrings at the start or end of the line and multiple
            occurrences are naturally handled by this regex.'

      - output:
          reasoning: The task is to match full lines containing the substring 'ead'
            or 'pro' anywhere. To do this, the regex should assert that the line contains
            either 'ead' or 'pro'. Using a positive lookahead (?=.*(?:ead|pro)) ensures
            that the substring appears somewhere in the line. The rest of the pattern
            (.*) matches the entire line, from start (^) to end ($), to match full
            lines that meet the criteria.

      - output:
          reasoning: 'The user wants to match entire lines that contain either the
            substring ''ead'' or ''pro'' anywhere within the line.


            Step 1: We want to match full lines, so we use ^ to mark the start of
            the line and $ to mark the end.


            Step 2: We want to ensure the line contains either ''ead'' or ''pro''
            somewhere.

            - We can use a positive lookahead (?=.*(?:ead|pro)) which asserts that
            somewhere after the start there is either ''ead'' or ''pro''.


            Step 3: After this assertion, match the entire line with .* (any characters)
            until the end.


            Step 4: Combined, ^(?=.*(?:ead|pro)).*$ matches any line that contains
            either ''ead'' or ''pro''.


            This fulfills the requirement to match lines containing either substring
            anywhere.'
