            Step 1: Identify the starting sequence. The word must start with ''ki''.


            Step 2: Allow for zero or more letters to follow. Using [a-zA-Z]* matches
            zero or more uppercase or lowercase letters.


            Step 3: Ensure matching whole words. Using word boundaries \b at the beginning
            and end ensures we are matching entire words that start with ''ki''.


            Thus, the regex \bki[a-zA-Z]*\b matches any word starting with ''ki''

            We need to match lines containing any word that begins with ''ki'' followed

            Step 2: Define what a ''word'' is.

            Assuming word boundaries are marked by non-word characters or line boundaries.
            We''ll use \b for word boundary.


            Step 3: Write a regex for the target word.

            The word should start with ''ki'' and may have zero or more letters after.

            Pattern: \bki[a-zA-Z]*\b


            Step 4: Match entire line containing such a word.

            We can use ^.* to match any characters at the start and .* to match any
            characters after.

            The full pattern is: ^.*\bki[a-zA-Z]*\b.*$

            1. We want to match words beginning with ''ki''. That means the word starts
            with ''k'' and ''i'' specifically.

            2. After ''ki'', the word can have zero or more letters (a-z or A-Z).

            3. Words are typically delimited by word boundaries, so we''ll use the
            word boundary anchor \b to ensure we match whole words rather than partial
            substrings inside larger words.


            Putting this together:

            - \b: word boundary to mark the start of the word

            - ki: the required prefix

            - [a-zA-Z]*: zero or more letters following ''ki''

            - \b: word boundary to mark the end of the word

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. We want to match any line (from start to end) that contains ''she''
            at least three times.

            2. Each occurrence of ''she'' can be anywhere in the line and they can

            as separate.

            3. To capture at least three occurrences, we can use a non-capturing group
            that matches any characters lazily up to ''she'', repeated at least three
            times.


            Explanation of the regex:

            - ^ : Start of the line

            - (?:.*?she){3,} : Non-capturing group matching any characters lazily

            by \b on both sides: \b\w{3}\b. Step 3: To ensure the line contains exactly
            one such word, and no more, we need to confirm that the line contains
            one occurrence of \b\w{3}\b and does not contain two or more. Step 4:
            One way is to use lookaheads: first, a positive lookahead to confirm the

            Step 6: To match lines with exactly one 3-letter word:

            - Use a negative lookahead to assert that there isn''t more than one \b\w{3}\b.


            Step 7: Also ensure the line contains only words separated by spaces (optional,

            Also, ensuring \b boundaries around these letter-only words guarantees
            whole word matches. This regex matches lines containing at least one whole
            word consisting of 5 or more letters, ignoring shorter words like 'five'
            (4 letters) or 'tiny' (4 letters), thereby correctly handling the edge

            we need to identify word boundaries and match sequences of letters (\w)
            of length 5 or more. The pattern \b\w{5,}\b matches a whole word with
            at least 5 letters. Wrapping this with ^.* and .* $ allows matching the
            entire line, ensuring that any line containing such a word is matched.

          reasoning: The regex '^.*\b\w{5,}\b.*$' matches any line that contains at
            least one word of length 5 or more. In the example 'cat dog bird', the
            word 'bird' has 4 letters, so it should not match based on 5 or more letters
            requirement. But since the user expected it to match, there might be confusion
            about the word length. If 'bird' was considered, it actually has 4 letters,
            so doesn't meet the 5-letter criterion. The regex correctly only matches
            words with 5 or more letters. For words like 'catch', 'apple', or 'house',
            the regex will match lines containing them. Thus, the regex correctly
            handles the requirement.

          reasoning: 'Let''s analyze the requirement and the test case:


            - We want lines that contain exactly one word of exactly 3 letters.

            - In the example `hi by an at`, the words are ''hi'' (2 letters), ''by''
            (2 letters), ''an'' (2 letters), ''at'' (2 letters). There is no 3-letter
            word, so this line should NOT match.


            Looking back at the original regex:

            - `(?=.*\b\w{3}\b)` asserts the presence of at least one 3-letter word.

            - `(?!.*(?:\b\w{3}\b){2,})` prevents two or more 3-letter words.


            However, in regex, quantifiers inside a lookahead like `{2,}` apply to
            the entire pattern. The issue is the regex may falsely count overlapping
            or non-overlapping matches incorrectly.


            To fix this, we can be more explicit in counting exactly one occurrence
            of a 3-letter word:


            - Use a positive lookahead for exactly one occurrence: `(?=(?:.*\b\w{3}\b){1})`

            - Use a negative lookahead to disallow two or more: `(?!.*(?:\b\w{3}\b){2,})`


            But this is redundant, so instead, a simpler approach is:

            - Use a positive lookahead for one 3-letter word: `(?=.*\b\w{3}\b)`

            - Use a negative lookahead to ensure no second 3-letter word appears after
            the first match, which can be complex.


            Alternatively, we can use a capturing approach:


            - Match the entire line: `^.*$`

            - Capture all 3-letter words: find them via `\b\w{3}\b`

            - Then, ensure only one occurrence:


            In regex, to ensure exactly one occurrence, we can write:


            - `^([^\w]*\w{3}[^\w]*)$` - But this is too strict.


            Therefore, keeping the previous approach with a small correction:


            - Change `(?!.*(?:\b\w{3}\b){2,})` to `(?!.*\b\w{3}\b.*\b\w{3}\b)` meaning
            no two or more 3-letter words anywhere else.


            Final regex:


            `^(?=.*\b\w{3}\b)(?!.*\b\w{3}\b.*\b\w{3}\b).*$`


            This ensures:

            - At least one 3-letter word.

            - No two or more 3-letter words (no occurrence of two 3-letter words anywhere
            in the line).


            So, the check works correctly, and will not match lines where there are
            no 3-letter words.


            Thus with the example `hi by an at`, no 3-letter word exists, so it does
            not match, which is the correct behavior now.'

            any non-letter characters optionally before and after the letter-only
            words. Specifically, [^a-zA-Z]* allows optional non-letter characters
            between words. The core word is matched by \b([a-zA-Z]+)\b to ensure only
            letter sequences count as words. The entire pattern is repeated at least
            five times {5,} to ensure five or more such words in the line. This approach
            flexibly handles punctuation marks attached to words by excluding them
            from matching, just counting the letters-only words towards the count.

          reasoning: 'The initial regex uses word boundaries and case-sensitive matching,
            which causes two issues:


            1. It incorrectly matches ''sandwich'' in ''sandwich-mechanism'', because
            a hyphen (-) is considered a word character boundary, so the word boundary
            matches there. But the user does not want matches where ''sandwich'' is
            part of a hyphenated compound word.


            2. It does not handle mixed case variations like ''SandwIch'' because
            the regex is case sensitive.


            To fix these, we:

            - Add the case-insensitive flag ''(?i)'' at the start to make the matching
            case insensitive.

            - Modify the word boundary logic to exclude matches where ''sandwich''
            is connected immediately via hyphen to other words.


            Since \b matches between a word character ([a-zA-Z0-9_]) and a non-word
            character or start/end of string, it considers hyphen ''-'' a non-word
            character, so the match allows sandwich-... as a separate word. To prevent
            that, we need to assert that the character before or after the word is
            not a letter or hyphen.


            We''ll use lookbehind and lookahead assertions:

            - For the left boundary: (?<![a-zA-Z-])

            - For the right boundary: (?![a-zA-Z-])


            This way, ''sandwich'' will not be matched if it is immediately preceded
            or followed by a letter or hyphen.


            The final regex is:

            ''(?i)^(?=.*(?<![a-zA-Z-])sandwich(?![a-zA-Z-])).*$''

            it can be:

            ''(?i)^.*(?<![a-zA-Z-])sandwich(?![a-zA-Z-]).*$''

            The given examples:

            - ''garden'' matches due to ''\bga'' at start and word boundary at end.

            - ''galloped'' matches similarly.

            - ''gala'' matches in the middle of the line.

            - ''game123'' matches since ''\w*'' includes digits.


            Given these examples are all covered by the original regex, the correct

            However, to accommodate cases where words may have trailing punctuation
            (like ''garden.''), we may adjust to ''\bga\w*\b'', because ''\w'' excludes

            manner and accommodates Unicode letters, apostrophes, and hyphens within
            words.


            - ''\b'' asserts word boundaries, ensuring whole words are matched.

            - ''ki'' specifies the starting characters; to handle case-insensitivity,
            the regex engine should apply a case-insensitive flag (e.g., /i), instead
            of explicitly listing uppercase letters.

            - ''[\p{L}''-]*'' matches zero or more Unicode letters (\p{L}), apostrophes,
            or hyphens, reflecting more realistic word characters.


            This regex assumes the regex engine supports Unicode properties (\p{L})
            and the case-insensitive flag. It avoids unnecessary anchors ''^.*'' and
            ''.*$'' since typical regex searches operate line-wise by default.


            This pattern successfully matches words like ''Ki'', ''kin'', "kid''s",
            ''kiosk-like'', or ''Kilo'' regardless of case, providing a flexible and
            accurate match for the problem statement.'

          reasoning: "To improve the regex based on the feedback, multiple aspects\
            \ were considered:\n\n1. **Case-Insensitivity:** Instead of hardcoding\
            \ case variants like `[Kk][Ii]`, it is assumed the regex engine supports\
            \ a case-insensitive flag (e.g., `/i`), or the user will enable it externally.\
            \ This keeps the regex clean.\n\n2. **Unicode Letters:** Using `\\p{L}`\
            \ matches any Unicode letter character rather than restricting to ASCII\
            \ `[a-zA-Z]`. This allows matching words starting with 'ki' followed by\
            \ any letters, including accented ones.\n\n3. **Word Definition:** Using\
            \ `\\b` for word boundaries ensures that 'ki' starts a word and the match\
            \ includes only the subsequent letters. The `*` quantifier after `\\p{L}`\
            \ permits zero or more letters after 'ki', matching words like \"ki\"\
            , \"king\", \"k\xEDlo\".\n\n4. **Removal of Redundant Anchors:** The start\
            \ and end anchors (`^.*` and `.*$`) were removed to avoid redundancy since\
            \ most regex search functions look for patterns anywhere in the input\
            \ by default.\n\n5. **Assumptions Clarified:** This regex assumes the\
            \ regex engine supports Unicode property escapes (e.g., in JavaScript\
            \ with the `/u` flag, or in languages like Python with the `regex` module,\
            \ or other modern engines).\n\n6. **Examples for clarity:**\n   - Matches:\
            \ \"The kid plays\", \"Walking in Kilo\", \"She said K\xCDngdom\"\n  \
            \ - Does not match: \"The kite flew\" (because 'kite' starts with 'ki'\
            \ but the regex will match it), but if precise word checks are needed,\
            \ this regex treats 'kite' as matching since it starts with 'ki' and followed\
            \ by letters.\n\nIf digits or underscores should be included in the matched\
            \ word characters after 'ki', replace `\\p{L}` with `\\w` (if `\\w` covers\
            \ those in the environment) or adjust accordingly.\n\n**Summary:** The\
            \ refined regex is `\\bki\\p{L}*\\b`, intended to be used with case-insensitive\
            \ and Unicode flags to properly match words starting with 'ki' followed\

            with "ki" regardless of case and may include letters, apostrophes, or
            hyphens afterwards (e.g., "Kiwi", "king''s", "ki-ki").


            1. Case-insensitivity: Instead of hardcoding uppercase letters in the
            character set, it''s better to apply a case-insensitive flag. In many
            regex engines (like Python''s re module, JavaScript, or PCRE), this is
            done with the /i flag. Since the regex string here is raw, we clarify
            the regex and note the case-insensitive flag should be applied during
            usage.


            2. Word boundaries: Using "\b" ensures we match whole words that start
            with "ki" and not substrings in the middle of words (e.g., we won''t match
            "skirt"). Note that "\b" matches word boundaries defined by transitions
            between word characters ([A-Za-z0-9_]) and non-word characters. This is
            sufficient for most English text environments.


            3. Character set after "ki": We allow letters (a-zA-Z) plus apostrophes
            and hyphens to include words like "king''s" and "ki-ki". This is expressed
            as "[a-zA-Z''-]*" meaning zero or more of these characters.


            4. Usage context: For example, in Python,


            import re

            pattern = re.compile(r"\bki[a-zA-Z''-]*\b", re.IGNORECASE)


            This regex finds words starting with any case variant of "ki" and continuing

            5. Limitations and edge cases: This regex assumes ASCII letters; it won''t
            match Unicode letters beyond a-z or A-Z. To handle non-ASCII letters,
            a Unicode-aware regex and appropriate flags would be needed.


            In summary, the complete solution is the regex "\bki[a-zA-Z''-]*\b" applied
            with case-insensitive matching, ensuring the match of whole words that

            Regex details:

            - `\b` asserts a word boundary to ensure full words are matched.

            - `[a-zA-Z]*` matches zero or more alphabetic letters before the vowel.

            - `[aeiou]` matches a single vowel (case-insensitive flag will handle
            uppercase).

            - `[a-zA-Z]*` matches zero or more alphabetic letters after the vowel.

            - `\b` asserts the end word boundary.


            Use the regex with the case-insensitive (`i`) flag to make vowel matching

            1. Word Definition: We aim to match words containing only letters, excluding
            digits and underscores. Thus, we use [a-zA-Z] to represent letters.


            2. Length Requirement: We need words with 5 or more letters. To achieve
            this, we ensure that the total letter count is at least 5.


            3. Handling Apostrophes and Hyphens: Words like "don''t" or "mother-in-law"
            contain apostrophes or hyphens internally, which should be considered
            part of a single word. To include these, we allow internal groups of ([''-][a-zA-Z]+),
            repeating zero or more times.


            4. Word Boundaries: \b at the start and end ensure matching whole words.


            5. The regex \b[a-zA-Z]+(?:[''-][a-zA-Z]+)*\b matches any word comprising
            letters with optional embedded apostrophes or hyphens.


            6. Length Check: Since the repetition includes letters plus optional embedded
            punctuation sequences, this regex matches words of any length. To enforce
            a minimum length of 5 letters, we must ensure the total number of letters
            is at least 5. This can be approximated by requiring the initial [a-zA-Z]+
            to match 1 or more, but total letters need to be counted.


            7. Because regex engines can''t easily count letters ignoring apostrophes
            and hyphens, a practical approach is to require the total pattern to have
            at least 5 letters excluding punctuation.


            8. To do this approximately, we can require the initial letter group to
            be at least 5 letters: [a-zA-Z]{5,} and allow zero or more ([''-][a-zA-Z]+)
            groups afterwards (which add letters but also punctuation). This ensures

            by 5 or more letters (upper or lowercase) and then another word boundary,
            ensuring full words of length 5 or more.


            We remove the redundant ^.* and .*$ because most regex engines perform
            search anywhere in the line by default, making those unnecessary.


            If Unicode letters (like accented characters) need to be supported, and
            the regex engine supports Unicode properties, \b\p{L}{5,}\b would be preferable,
            but for ASCII letters, [a-zA-Z] suffices.


            Finally, note that the regex is case-sensitive; adding a case-insensitive
            flag (e.g., /i) can simplify matching uppercase and lowercase letters,
            but here we''ve included both in the character class.'

            To ensure matching only alphabetic words of length 5 or more, this improved
            regex uses the character class [A-Za-z] to match only ASCII letters. The
            word boundaries \b ensure the match is for whole words. The previous use
            of ^.* and .*$ was unnecessary since the regex engine can test for the
            presence of a match anywhere in the line, simplifying and improving performance.


            This regex does not consider Unicode letters beyond ASCII; if needed,
            Unicode-aware regex engines may use classes like \p{L}. Also, it doesn''t
            consider apostrophes or hyphens as part of words; thus contractions (e.g.,
            "it''s") or hyphenated words are split into separate words. To include
            these, further refinement would be required depending on specific requirements.


            The regex matching is case-insensitive by default in many engines, but
            if case sensitivity is required, flags can be set accordingly.


            Examples:

            - "Hello world!" matches "Hello" (5 letters)

            - "It''s a sunny day" matches "sunny" (5 letters)

            - "e-mail" is considered as two words "e" and "mail", matching "mail"
            (4 letters, so no match)

            - Words with digits like "abc123" or underscores like "abc_def" won''t
            match because they include non-letter characters

            We use ''\d+0'' to ensure the number has at least one digit before the
            trailing zero (allowing ''0'' itself to match).


            Step 2: Allow an optional leading ''-'' sign for negative numbers by including
            ''\-?''. This handles negative numbers divisible by 10.


            Step 3: To avoid matching parts of larger numbers, we use lookarounds
            instead of word boundaries. The negative lookbehind ''(?<![\d-])'' ensures
            that the number is not preceded by a digit or minus sign (so it doesn''t
            match inside a bigger number or negative sign sequence).


            Similarly, the negative lookahead ''(?!\d)'' ensures the number is not
            immediately followed by another digit, preventing partial matches within
            longer numbers.


            Step 4: This pattern does not include decimal points or commas because
            "divisible by 10" applies to integers, and handling decimals or formatted

            Step 5: Usage considerations: When using this regex in a multiline text,
            applying ''re.search'' per line can detect if the line contains at least
            one number divisible by 10. Using ''re.findall'' can get all such matches

            Step 6: Edge cases: The number ''0'' will be matched as ''\-?\d+0'' because

            Step 2: Enforce at least one digit before the trailing zero using ''\d+0''

            Step 3: Handle optional sign by adding ''[+-]?'' at the start to match
            ''+10'', ''-20'', or ''30''.


            Step 4: Improve boundary matching. While ''\b'' usually works to detect
            word boundaries, it can fail or be ambiguous when the number is adjacent
            to punctuation or decimal points. For example, ''1230.'' or ''(+20)''
            may cause issues. To address this, negative lookbehind ''(?<![\w.])''
            and negative lookahead ''(?![\w.])'' are used to ensure that the matched

            Step 5: Exclude decimal or floating-point numbers by disallowing dots
            adjacent to the match. This means numbers like ''10.0'' won''t be matched,
            which aligns with the problem as it doesn''t specify floats.


            Step 6: Examples:

            - Matches: ''10'', ''0'', ''-20'', ''+30'', ''1230''

            - Non-matches: ''123'', ''abc1230xyz'', ''10.0'', ''1,000''


            Step 7: Clarification: Numbers with commas or decimal points are not handled,
            assuming input consists of signed integers.


            This refined regex robustly matches signed integers ending with ''0''
            while avoiding unintended matches with partial or embedded numbers.'

      - output:
          reasoning: 'Step 1: We need to match numbers divisible by 10, which end
            with ''0''. To ensure the number is valid, it must have at least one digit
            before the ending zero, so we use ''\d+0'' instead of ''\d*0'' to avoid
            empty matches.


            Step 2: To optionally include negative numbers (e.g., -10), we allow an
            optional leading minus sign using ''-?''. This covers cases where negative
            divisible-by-10 numbers are relevant.


            Step 3: We apply ''\b'' (word boundaries) around the number to ensure
            it''s isolated and not part of a larger alphanumeric sequence. Word boundaries
            specify positions between word characters (letters, digits, underscore)
            and non-word characters.


            Step 4: Limitations of word boundaries: They work well for most textual
            data but may fail if numbers are directly attached to punctuation (e.g.,
            ''abc100def'' won''t match since boundaries aren''t there, which is intended;
            ''abc100 def'' matches).


            Step 5: The regex does not currently cover decimal numbers or numbers
            with commas; these require more complex patterns depending on specificity.
            The problem statement doesn''t specify these formats, so we assume only
            integers.


            Step 6: Leading zeros are allowed implicitly by ''\d+''. For example,
            ''010'' matches as it''s digits ending with ''0''.


            Step 7: Applying this regex to lines (e.g., with grep -P ''\b-?\d+0\b''
            or language-specific regex functions) enables identification of lines
            containing such numbers. Lines with at least one match qualify.


            Step 8: Example test cases:

            - ''The value is 10.'' -> matches ''10''

            - ''Temperature: -20 degrees'' -> matches ''-20''

            - ''Order number 0'' -> matches ''0''

            - ''abc100def'' -> no match (number embedded within letters)

            numbers ending with ''0'' (i.e., divisible by 10).


            Step 2: Build the core pattern for matching such numbers:

            - Use ''\d+'' to ensure at least one digit before the final ''0'', avoiding
            empty matches.

            - Append ''0'' explicitly to ensure the number ends with zero.

            - This forms ''\d+0''.


            Step 3: Consider optional sign support:

            - Include ''-?'' to optionally match a negative sign before the digits.

            - This results in ''-?\d+0''.


            Step 4: Use word boundaries ''\b'' to ensure we only match complete numbers
            and avoid partial matches embedded inside words or longer digit sequences.

            - So ''\b-?\d+0\b'' ensures the number is not part of a larger token.


            Step 5: Avoid anchoring the regex with ''^.*'' or ''.*$'' since the goal
            is to search for matching numbers anywhere within a line, not match the
            entire line.


            Additional Notes:

            - This regex matches numbers like ''10'', ''-20'', ''0070''. It accepts
            leading zeros as they are often valid numerically, but this can be adjusted
            if needed.

            - It does not match decimal numbers like ''10.0'' because of the word
            boundaries and lack of ''.'' in the pattern; adapting for decimals requires
            more complexity.

            - Matching ''0'' alone is not included since the pattern requires at least
            one digit before the trailing zero; if ''0'' is needed, pattern can be
            expanded.

            - Word boundaries ''\b'' depend on the regex engine; they match transitions
            between word characters (alphanumeric plus underscore) and non-word characters
            (spaces, punctuation).

            - This pattern effectively matches numbers divisible by 10 (ending with
            zero), with optional negative sign, embedded anywhere within lines.'

            This regex works as follows:

            - (?:[^\d]*\d){2,} : a non-capturing group that matches any number of
            non-digit characters followed by a digit, repeated at least twice.


            This ensures at least two digits occur in order, with any characters in
            between.


            Anchors (^ and $) are omitted to keep the regex flexible, as their necessity
            depends on the environment and usage.


            Edge cases:

            - Lines with zero or one digit won''t match since the digit group must
            appear at least twice.

            - Empty lines naturally do not match, satisfying the requirement.


            For multi-line input, use appropriate flags (e.g., multiline mode) to
            process lines individually if needed.'
          regex: (?:[^\d]*\d){2,}

          reasoning: 'Step 1: The requirement is to match lines containing at least
            two digits (0-9), where digits can be anywhere in the line in any order.


            Step 2: Use the pattern ''(?:[^\d]*\d){2,}'' which breaks down as:

            - ''[^\d]*'' matches zero or more non-digit characters. This ensures digits
            can be anywhere and are not necessarily consecutive.

            - ''\d'' matches a single digit (0-9). Note: In many regex flavors, ''\d''
            matches Unicode digits as well, but assuming ASCII digits here. If this
            is not desired, ''[0-9]'' can replace ''\d''.

            - ''{2,}'' requires at least two such digit occurrences.


            Step 3: Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are used to ensure matching the entire
            line. When used with multiline mode, ''^'' and ''$'' match the start and
            end of each line, respectively.


            Step 4: The trailing ''.*'' is removed to simplify the regex, as the quantified
            pattern already accounts for the entire line.


            Step 5: Examples:

            - ''abc123'' matches (digits: ''1'',''2'',''3'')

            - ''a1b2c'' matches (digits: ''1'',''2'')

            - ''a1b'' does not match (only one digit)

            - ''abc'' does not match (no digits)


            Step 6: Performance considerations: using ''[^\d]*'' is efficient as it
            matches any non-digit characters lazily until the next digit, avoiding
            backtracking issues.

            Core pattern explanation:

            - (?:[^\d]*\d){2,} matches any number of non-digit characters followed
            by a digit, repeated two or more times. This ensures at least two digits
            appear.

            - ^ anchors the match to the start of the line.


            Edge cases:

            - Lines with exactly two digits match correctly, as the pattern requires
            a minimum of two digits.

            - Digits at the very start or end of lines are handled, since [^\d]* allows
            zero non-digit characters before the digit.

            - Digits separated by spaces or special characters are matched as non-digit
            characters between digits.


            Regarding the trailing ''.*$'': it is unnecessary because the repeating
            pattern consumes characters up to the second digit, and since we''re just
            checking for presence (not extracting), anchoring to the start is sufficient.


            Alternatives:

            - Using a positive lookahead like `^(?=(?:.*\d){2})` can also ensure at
            least two digits anywhere in the line, which some may find more readable.


            Note on escaping:

            - In many programming languages, backslashes must be escaped (e.g., `\\d`
            in some string literals). Here, `\d` represents the digit character class
            correctly assuming standard regex usage.


            This solution balances clarity, correctness, and performance for checking
            if a line contains at least two digits.'

        score: 1.0
      - output:
          reasoning: 'This regex matches lines containing at least two digits anywhere.


            - Explanation: The pattern (?:.*\d){2} requires that there are two occurrences
            of any characters followed by a digit, ensuring at least two digits in
            the line. The anchors ^ and $ signify matching the entire line.


            - Digit Definition: The \d matches ASCII digits (0-9) per standard regex
            engines.


            - Environment: Assumes a typical regex engine where ^ and $ match start
            and end of a line respectively, with multi-line flag enabled if testing
            multiple lines.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "abc123", "no digits 4 here 5", "12"

            - Does not match: "no digits here", "a1b"

            the regex to ''\b[qQ]\w*\b'' directly matches any word starting with ''q''
            or ''Q''. The reasoning behind this step-by-step approach is as follows:


            1. Word Boundary: ''\b'' ensures the match starts at the beginning of
            a word.

            2. Character Class: ''[qQ]'' matches either lowercase ''q'' or uppercase
            ''Q'', making the regex case-insensitive without relying on flags.

            3. Word Characters: ''\w*'' matches zero or more word characters (letters,
            digits, underscore) after the initial ''q'' or ''Q''.

            4. Ending Word Boundary: ''\b'' ensures the word ends cleanly.


            Regarding Unicode: While ''\w'' traditionally matches ASCII letters, digits,
            and underscore, in many modern regex engines with Unicode support, ''\w''
            matches Unicode word characters. If extended Unicode matching is needed,
            the regex engine''s Unicode mode should be enabled.


            Example Test Cases:

            - Does not match: "apple", "queenly" (if lowercase ''q'' missing), or
            words not starting with ''q'' or ''Q''.


            This simplified regex efficiently captures lines containing at least one

            or ''Q'', the regex should look for word boundaries and the first letter
            being ''q'' or ''Q''.


            Refinement steps:

            1. Case sensitivity: Since words can start with both ''q'' and ''Q'',
            include both by using the character class [qQ] or enable a case-insensitive
            flag (e.g., /i) if supported.

            2. Remove unnecessary anchors (^ and $) and greedy quantifiers (.*), as
            the regex will be used to search within lines, not necessarily match the
            entire line.

            3. Use the word boundary \b to ensure we are matching entire words starting
            specifically with ''q'' or ''Q''.

            4. Use \w* to match zero or more word characters following the initial
            ''q'' or ''Q''.

            5. Consider the regex engine''s Unicode support: \w typically matches
            [A-Za-z0-9_], so if Unicode word characters matter, the regex would need
            Unicode property support (e.g., \p{L} for letters).


            Example matches:

            - "Quick brown fox" matches because ''Quick'' starts with ''Q''.

            - "The queen reigns" matches due to ''queen''.

            - "This is equal" matches because ''equal'' contains ''q'', but it doesn''t
            start with ''q'', so no match on that word (correct behavior). Only words
            starting with ''q'' are considered.


            In summary, the regex ''\b[qQ]\w*\b'' efficiently identifies words starting

            \ these simplifies the regex.\n4. The word boundary '\\b' before and after\
            \ ensures that we're matching whole words starting with 'q' or 'Q'. This\
            \ works well even when the word is at the beginning, end, or surrounded\
            \ by punctuation.\n5. Testing examples:\n   - \"quick brown fox\" matches\
            \ because of \"quick\" at the start.\n   - \"Enquire now!\" matches because\
            \ \"Enquire\" has \"Q\" after \"E\", but since we need words starting\
            \ with 'q', only words starting with 'q' or 'Q' count. \"Enquire\" starts\
            \ with 'E', so no match.\n   - \"Quality is key.\" matches because \"\
            Quality\" starts with 'Q'.\n   - \"No match here.\" does not match as\
            \ there's no word starting with 'q' or 'Q'.\n6. This regex balances simplicity\

          reasoning: 'Ensuring that a line contains at least three distinct words
            solely with a regex is extremely challenging because regex engines generally
            cannot store and compare multiple captured groups to verify their distinctness.
            Instead, the recommended approach is a two-step process:


            1. Use a simple regex like `\b(\w+)\b` globally to extract all words from
            a line. This regex matches all words defined as continuous sequences of
            alphanumeric characters and underscores.


            2. In external code (e.g., Python, JavaScript), process the extracted
            words to normalize case (e.g., convert all to lowercase) and determine
            the count of distinct words. Then check if this count is at least three.


            This approach handles edge cases such as punctuation (since punctuation
            is excluded by \w), and allows case-insensitive distinctness checking.


            For example:


            Input line: "Hello, hello! How are you?"

            Words extracted: ["Hello", "hello", "How", "are", "you"]

            Lowercased: ["hello", "hello", "how", "are", "you"]

            Distinct words count: 4 ("hello", "how", "are", "you")

            Result: matches requirement.


            If you require a self-contained regex solution, some advanced engines
            supporting branch reset groups, conditional patterns, or recursion might
            attempt to enforce distinctness, but these solutions are complex, inefficient,
            and not portable.


            Therefore, the proposed solution favors extracting words with regex and
            enforcing distinctness outside regex for reliability, performance, and
            clarity.'

            \ of using pure regex to accurately detect lines with at least three distinct\
            \ words, here is an improved approach:\n\n1. **Regex Component:**\n  \
            \ - The provided regex `^(?:\\W*\\w+\\W+){2,}\\w+\\W*$` is designed to\
            \ match lines that contain at least three words.\n   - Explanation:\n\
            \     - `\\w+` matches a word consisting of word characters.\n     - `\\\
            W*` matches any number of non-word characters (such as punctuation or\
            \ spaces).\n     - `(?:\\W*\\w+\\W+){2,}` matches at least two occurrences\
            \ of a word, each possibly preceded and followed by non-word characters.\n\
            \     - Followed by `\\w+\\W*` ensures there is a third word.\n   - This\
            \ regex successfully ensures the presence of at least three words on a\
            \ line, but it does **not** ensure these words are distinct.\n\n2. **Why\
            \ pure regex cannot reliably check for distinct words:**\n   - Regular\
            \ expressions do not have native capabilities to count unique matches\
            \ or to normalize cases for comparison.\n   - They also are not well-suited\

            \n3. **Recommendation \u2014 Hybrid Approach:**\n   - Use the regex to\
            \ extract words from the line.\n   - Normalize the extracted words (e.g.,\

            \ Instead of relying on backreferences (\\1, \\2) inside lookaheads to\
            \ enforce distinctness of words\u2014which is known to be unreliable and\

            \ some engines, but it's the best viable pure regex solution.\n\n2. **Expanded\
            \ word definition:** Instead of using `\\w+` (limited to ASCII letters,\
            \ digits, underscore), I used a Unicode-aware class `[\\p{L}][\\p{L}'-]*`\
            \ to match words starting with a Unicode letter followed by letters, apostrophes,\
            \ or hyphens. This better captures words like \"can't\", \"co-operate\"\
            , and words with accented letters.\n\n3. **Applied Unicode awareness:**\
            \ This regex assumes the regex engine supports Unicode properties (`\\\
            p{L}`) and Unicode-aware boundaries (`\\b`) to properly identify word\
            \ boundaries in Unicode text.\n\n4. **Removed ambiguous reasoning about\
            \ variable length lookbehind:** The regex uses only lookaheads and no\

          reasoning: 'The user''s goal is to identify lines containing at least three
            distinct words. However, as the feedback correctly points out, regex alone
            is insufficient to reliably count distinct words within a line due to
            inherent limitations:


            1. Regex cannot dynamically store and compare multiple different capturing
            groups across a line to enforce uniqueness.

            2. Backreferences do not help in enforcing distinctness dynamically over
            the entire line.

            3. Case insensitivity needs to be handled.

            4. The definition of word should be expanded to support Unicode letters
            and common intra-word punctuation like apostrophes.


            Given these points, the best approach is to use regex to **extract all
            words** in a line, defined as sequences of Unicode letters and apostrophes,
            in a case-insensitive manner. Then, programmatically count the number
            of unique words.


            The provided regex:


            - Uses the Unicode property `\p{L}` to match any kind of letter from any
            language.

            - Includes apostrophes (`''`) within words to correctly capture contractions
            like "don''t".

            - Employs word boundaries `\b` to ensure whole word matching.

            - Uses the case-insensitive flag `(?i)` so that words differing only in
            case (e.g., "Word" vs "word") are treated as the same in subsequent programmatic
            counting.


            **Practical usage:"

            - Use this regex to extract all matching words from each line.

            - Normalize them (e.g., to lowercase).

            - Count the number of distinct words.

            - Consider the line as matching if the count is at least three.


            **Example test cases:**


            - Input: "Hello world world!" -> Extracted words: ["Hello", "world", "world"]
            -> Distinct words: 2 -> Does not match.

            - Input: "Hello world Hello there" -> Extracted words: ["Hello", "world",
            "Hello", "there"] -> Distinct words: 3 -> Matches.

            - Input: "Don''t stop believing!" -> Extracted words: ["Don''t", "stop",
            "believing"] -> Distinct words: 3 -> Matches.

          reasoning: 'To correctly identify lines containing at least three occurrences
            of ''she'', including overlapping occurrences, we need a regex that counts
            every ''she'' substring, even if they overlap.


            1. **Handling overlapping occurrences:** Standard patterns like ''she.*she.*she''
            won''t detect overlapping instances because ''.*'' consumes characters
            greedily, thus skipping potential overlapping matches.


            2. **Non-greedy matching:** By using ''.*?'' (non-greedy), we allow the
            regex engine to match the shortest possible sequences between ''she''
            occurrences, increasing chances of counting overlapping instances.


            3. **Using a lookahead with repetition:** The pattern ''(?:.*?she){3,}''
            inside a positive lookahead ''(?=...)'' asserts that there are at least
            three occurrences of ''she'' anywhere in the line.


            4. **Anchoring and matching full line:** We anchor at the start ''^''
            to begin looking from the line''s start, and ''.*$'' consumes the entire
            line, ensuring the match covers complete lines.


            5. **Regex flavor considerations:** This regex uses standard constructs
            supported by most modern regex engines (PCRE, Python, JavaScript), but
            counting overlapping matches directly isn''t feasible in most regexes
            without external code. The non-greedy repetition in the lookahead approximates
            this behavior.


            **Examples:**

            - ''sheshe'' contains ''she'' at positions 0 and 2 (overlapping), so it
            has at least two occurrences; to have three, e.g., ''shesheshe'' contains
            ''she'' at positions 0, 2, and 5.


            - The regex would match lines like ''shesheshe'' (3 occurrences), ''she
            she she'' (3 occurrences), but not ''she she'' (only 2 occurrences).


            This improved regex better accounts for overlapping occurrences by using

            of the substring ''she'', counting overlapping occurrences anywhere in
            the line without requiring word boundaries. Here''s the detailed reasoning:


            1. **Case Sensitivity:** The pattern ''she'' is in lowercase; to match
            ''she'' in any case (e.g., ''She'', ''SHE''), use this regex with the
            case-insensitive flag `/i` in your regex engine (e.g., `/^(?=(?:.*?she){3,}).*$/i`).
            This ensures that all case variations are matched.


            2. **Positive Lookahead:** `(?=(?:.*?she){3,})` is a positive lookahead
            starting at the beginning of the line (`^`). It asserts that there are
            at least three occurrences of the substring ''she'' anywhere in the line.
            The `.*?` is a non-greedy match of any characters (including none) to
            ensure the lookahead progresses efficiently and allows overlapping matches.


            3. **Counting Overlapping Occurrences:** Because `.*?she` can match overlapped
            instances (e.g., in ''sheshe'', ''she'' appears twice overlapping), this
            pattern counts overlapping ''she'' occurrences.


            4. **Trailing `.*$`:** After asserting the presence of at least three
            ''she'' occurrences, `.*$` consumes the entire line to make the regex
            engine proceed through the line, ensuring the full line matches if the
            lookahead condition is met.


            5. **Performance Considerations:** Using `.*?` (non-greedy) inside the
            lookahead reduces excessive backtracking, improving performance on long
            lines compared to nested greedy quantifiers.


            6. **No Word Boundaries:** The regex matches ''she'' as any substring,
            not necessarily standalone words. If matching only whole words ''she''
            is desired, the pattern and reasoning would need to be adjusted.


            **Summary:** Use this regex with a case-insensitive flag to efficiently
            filter lines containing at least three substrings ''she'' (including overlapping
            matches) anywhere in the line, with clear explanation of how the lookahead
            works and the overall pattern.'

            \ with a global search in a scripting language or tools like grep with\
            \ options.\n- This solution assumes case-sensitive matching; to make it\
            \ case-insensitive, use regex flags accordingly (e.g., /i in many languages)."

      - output:
          reasoning: 'Step 1: Clarify the matching criteria: the substring ''she''
            should be matched as a whole word, not as a part of another word, so word
            boundaries (\b) are used around ''she''.


            Step 2: Avoid excessive backtracking and complex lookaheads by using a
            non-capturing group ''(?:.*?)'' that lazily matches any characters leading
            up to each occurrence of ''\bshe\b''.


            Step 3: Use quantifier ''{3,}'' on this group to require at least three
            non-overlapping occurrences.


            Step 4: The ''^'' and ''.*$'' anchor the match to the whole line, ensuring
            the entire line is matched if it contains at least three whole word occurrences
            of ''she''.


            Step 5: This regex avoids complex positive lookaheads and reduces backtracking
            by matching occurrences sequentially.


            Step 6: Note that case sensitivity depends on the regex engine; add case-insensitive
            flag if needed externally.


            Summary: The regex ''^(?:.*?\bshe\b){3,}.*$'' matches any line containing
            ''she'' at least three times as whole words, handling non-overlapping
            occurrences efficiently and improving performance and readability over
            the previous solution.'

          reasoning: 'The goal is to match lines containing at least three occurrences
            of the substring ''she'', accounting for overlapping occurrences and avoiding
            performance pitfalls.


            Step 1: Address overlapping matches.

            - The substring ''she'' can appear in overlapping positions (e.g., in
            ''sheshe'', ''she'' occurs twice overlapping).

            - Using ''.*?she'' (non-greedy) instead of ''.*she'' helps in minimal
            matching to find successive occurrences without skipping overlapping ones.


            Step 2: Use a positive lookahead to assert the presence of at least three
            occurrences.

            - ''(?=(?:.*?she){3,})'' ensures the line contains three or more occurrences
            without consuming characters.


            Step 3: Anchor line start and match the entire line with ''^.*$''.


            Step 4: Consider case sensitivity.

            - Since the problem does not explicitly specify case sensitivity, common
            practice is to make the regex case-insensitive by adding the ''i'' flag
            (implementation dependent).


            This pattern avoids catastrophic backtracking by using non-greedy quantifiers
            and handles overlapping occurrences. For example, on ''sheshe'', it correctly
            identifies two overlapping ''she''s. It efficiently ensures a minimum
            count of occurrences within a single regex.


            If performance with very long lines is a concern, counting occurrences
            in code might be preferable, but within regex capabilities, this is a

            \ length three.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Words are sequences of alphanumeric\
            \ characters and underscores (`\\w`), as matched by regex `\\w+`.\n- Words\
            \ are delimited by word boundaries (`\\b`), which handle cases like punctuation.\n\
            - Lines may contain multiple words, separated by any whitespace.\n- Lines\
            \ may contain punctuation adjacent to words; word boundaries help isolate\
            \ proper words.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Ensure at least\
            \ one 3-letter word:**\n   Using `(?=.*\\b\\w{3}\\b)` -- a positive lookahead\
            \ that asserts somewhere in the line there exists a word boundary `\\\
            b`, followed by exactly three word characters `\\w{3}`, then another word\
            \ boundary.\n\n2. **Ensure no more than one 3-letter word:**\n   Using\
            \ negative lookahead `(?!.*\\b\\w{3}\\b.*\\b\\w{3}\\b)` -- asserts that\
            \ there are NOT two or more 3-letter words. This checks the pattern twice\
            \ separated by anything.\n\n3. **Match the entire line:**\n   `^` and\
            \ `$` anchors ensure the regex applies to the whole line.\n\n4. **Match\
            \ rest of line:**\n   `.*$` consumes the entire line after lookaheads\
            \ have asserted the constraints.\n\n**Why this works:**\n- The combination\
            \ of a positive lookahead for one 3-letter word, and a negative lookahead\
            \ preventing a second, ensures exactly one such word exists.\n- `\\b`\
            \ word boundaries properly handle punctuation adjacent to words.\n- `\\\
            w` includes letters, digits, underscore, which is common in word definitions\
            \ in regex. For more complex word characters (e.g., hyphens, apostrophes),\
            \ additional logic or preprocessing would be required.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\
            - This regex depends on the regex engine supporting lookaheads.\n- It\
            \ treats words as contiguous `\\w` characters; words like \"can't\" or\
            \ \"e-mail\" would be split due to apostrophe or hyphen.\n\n**Examples:**\n\
            - \"foo bar baz\" \u2192 **No** (3 words, two are 3 letters: \"foo\",\
            \ \"bar\", \"baz\")\n- \"hello foo world\" \u2192 **Yes** (only \"foo\"\

            \" (empty line) \u2192 **No**\n\n**Recommendation:**\nFor more accurate\
            \ results in natural language text (handling apostrophes, hyphens), consider\
            \ splitting lines into words programmatically and count the length of\

            1. Use a positive lookahead `(?=...)` at the start of the line to assert
            that the pattern inside occurs somewhere in the string without consuming
            characters.

            2. Inside the lookahead, `(?:.*\b[a-zA-Z]+\b){5,}` matches any characters
            `.*` followed by a full letter-only word `\b[a-zA-Z]+\b` at least 5 times.
            This allows words to be anywhere in the line, separated by any characters.

            3. The `\b` word boundaries ensure that only complete words made up entirely
            of letters are matched, avoiding partial matches within numbers or mixed
            tokens.

            4. After the lookahead, `.*$` matches the entire line to allow the pattern
            to be applied to the full line.


            This pattern works under engines that support lookaheads and enables detection
            of at least five letter-only words anywhere on a line, properly handling
            punctuation, spacing, and other separators. Note that the regex is case-sensitive
            by design as `[a-zA-Z]` includes both cases; if Unicode letters or broader
            locales are needed, the pattern can be adjusted accordingly.


            Testing this regex against various inputs such as lines with exactly five
            words, lines with extra punctuation or tabs, or mixed tokens confirms

            ''4'' is directly between ''3'' and ''5'' with no other digits in between.


            Given the feedback, we need to refine the regex to ensure ''4'' directly

            also want to disallow other digits between these three digits so that
            the ''4'' is truly between ''3'' and ''5''.


            Step 1: Match ''3''.

            Step 2: Between ''3'' and ''4'', allow zero or more non-digit characters
            using ''[^\d]*''. This prevents other digits interfering.

            Step 3: Match ''4''.

            Step 4: Between ''4'' and ''5'', also allow zero or more non-digit characters

            Step 5: Match ''5''.


            This pattern ''3[^\d]*4[^\d]*5'' ensures ''4'' appears between ''3'' and
            ''5'' directly with no other digits in between, though non-digit characters
            can occur between them.


            If the line contains multiple digits or multiple occurrences, this regex
            will match occurrences where ''3'' precedes ''4'' which precedes ''5''
            with no digits in between these three digits.


            This approach assumes that having other non-digit characters between the

          reasoning: 'The problem requires matching lines where the digit ''4'' appears
            strictly between ''3'' and ''5'' in order, with no ''3'' or ''5'' interrupting
            the sequence prematurely. The initial regex ''3.*4.*5'' matches any line
            containing ''3'' somewhere before ''4'', which is somewhere before ''5'',
            but it doesn''t prevent other ''3''s or ''5''s from appearing in between,
            potentially breaking the intended sequence.


            To refine this:

            - Start by matching a ''3''.

            - Then match any number of characters that are NOT ''3'' or ''5'' until
            we find a ''4''. This ensures no other ''3'' or ''5'' appears before the
            ''4''. The pattern ''[^35]*4'' does this.

            - The ''(?:[^35]*4)+'' allows for multiple ''4''s between ''3'' and ''5'',
            requiring at least one ''4''.

            - After the last ''4'', match any number of characters that are not ''3''
            or ''5'', then a terminating ''5''.


            This regex enforces the order ''3'' -> ''4'' (one or more) -> ''5'' without
            intervening ''3''s or ''5''s that could invalidate the ordering.


            Note:

            - This interpretation assumes ''4'' must be strictly between ''3'' and
            ''5'' and no other ''3'' or ''5'' can intervene.

            - It allows other characters besides digits between them, except digits
            ''3'' or ''5''.

            - If consecutive digits without characters in between are required, the
            regex would be different.


            Example Matches:

            - ''abc3xyz4def5ghi'' matches

            - ''3a4b4c5'' matches


            Non-Matches:

            - ''3a5b4'' (4 is not after 3 and before 5 in order)

            - ''3a4b5c3'' (second ''3'' after 5 is irrelevant but does not invalidate)


            This solution better limits false positives and aligns with clarified
            constraints.'

            ''4'' and ''5'' after the first ''3''. To better ensure ''4'' appears
            between ''3'' and ''5'' while handling possible multiple digits and to
            prevent excessive skipping, the regex should be non-greedy: ''3.*?4.*?5''.
            This pattern matches the shortest sequence from ''3'' to ''4'' and from

            - Using ''\byou\b'' ensures ''you'' is matched as a complete word, not
            part of another word (e.g., excludes ''yours'' or ''younger'').


            Step 2: Allow optional trailing whitespace

            - ''\s*'' after ''you'' allows for any number of spaces or tabs following
            the word.


            Step 3: Allow for optional punctuation before the end of line

            - ''[.,!?:;'']*'' allows zero or more common punctuation marks (like period,
            comma, exclamation mark, question mark, colon, semicolon, apostrophe)
            after ''you'' and before trailing whitespace.


            Step 4: Match from the start of line

            - ''^.*'' ensures the pattern matches the entire line up to the target
            word.


            Step 5: Handle multi-line strings

            - Using the multi-line mode flag ''(?m)'' makes ''^'' and ''$'' match
            the start and end of each line within a block of text.


            Step 6: Handle case insensitivity

            - The ''(?i)'' flag makes the match case insensitive, so it matches ''you'',
            ''You'', ''YOU'', etc.


            Putting it all together: ''(?im)^.*\byou\b[\s]*[.,!?:;'']*$''

            - ''thank yous''          -> does not match (because ''you'' is not a
            whole word here)


            Note: The regex assumes usage with a regex engine that supports inline

            Step 4: Allow optional whitespace (\s*) after this punctuation before
            the end of the line to handle trailing spaces.

            \ (\\b):**\n   - The '\\b' is a zero-width assertion that matches the\

            \ Overview:**\n   - `^` and `$` are anchors that match the start and end\
            \ of a line respectively.\n   - `(?=.*[A-Z])` is a positive lookahead\
            \ ensuring at least one uppercase English alphabet letter exists anywhere\
            \ in the line.\n   - `.*` matches any characters (including none) to allow\
            \ matching the entire line once the lookahead condition is satisfied.\n\
            \n2. **Multiline Matching:**\n   - If the input contains multiple lines\
            \ and you want to apply this regex to each line individually, enable multiline\
            \ mode (often via the `m` flag).\n   - Multiline mode makes `^` and `$`\
            \ match the start and end of each line, not just the start and end of\
            \ the entire input.\n\n3. **Unicode and Locale Considerations:**\n   -\
            \ `[A-Z]` matches only ASCII uppercase letters.\n   - If the input may\
            \ contain uppercase letters in other Unicode scripts (e.g., accented letters,\
            \ Cyrillic, Greek), consider using Unicode-aware regex syntax if supported.\n\
            \     - For example, in some engines, `\\p{Lu}` matches any uppercase\
            \ letter in Unicode.\n   - If Unicode uppercase detection is needed, replace\
            \ `[A-Z]` with a Unicode-aware pattern.\n\n4. **Lookahead Support and\
            \ Compatibility:**\n   - Positive lookaheads `(?=...)` are widely supported\
            \ in modern regex engines (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.).\n   - For\
            \ environments where lookaheads are not supported, a simpler pattern such\
            \ as `.*[A-Z].*` (with multiline mode) can be used to match lines containing\
            \ uppercase letters.\n\n5. **Behavior with Empty or Non-Letter Lines:**\n\
            \   - Lines that are empty or contain only lowercase letters or non-letter\
            \ characters will **not** match because they lack uppercase letters.\n\
            \n6. **Examples:**\n   - Matches:\n     - \"Hello World\"\n     - \"123\
            \ ABC 456\"\n     - \"This is a Test\"\n   - Does not match:\n     - \"\

            the regex and improving efficiency. If matching across multiline strings,

            Assumptions and context:

            - Matching is case-sensitive; only uppercase A-Z are matched.

            - Input is processed line-by-line or as multi-line text with separate
            matching per line.

            - If matching lines within a multi-line string, a tool or method that
            tests each line independently, or a multiline flag, should be used accordingly.

            - For Unicode uppercase letters (e.g., accented capitals), use a Unicode-aware
            regex like ''\p{Lu}'' if supported.


            Examples:

            - "hello World" -> Matches (''W'' is uppercase).

            - "no capitals here" -> No match.

            - "123 ABC" -> Matches (''A'',''B'',''C'').

            - "!@#" -> No match.


            Edge cases:

            - Empty lines do not match (no characters).

            - Lines with only non-alphabetic chars do not match.


            Summary: Using ''[A-Z]'' with case-sensitive matching is a concise, effective

            matches rather than extracting only the words themselves. For example,
            in code or tools, lines containing matches with this pattern can be extracted.\n3.
            To handle case insensitivity (words like ''Age'', ''VILLAGE''), the regex

            To handle punctuation adjacent to words (e.g., ''village,'' or ''college.''),

            apostrophes, and hyphens (commonly part of English words and contractions).

            - Case sensitivity should be ignored to capture ''Ge'', ''GE'', etc.


            Step 2: Construct regex

            - Use word boundary \b to ensure the match corresponds to complete words.

            - Use character class [\w''-]+ to match one or more valid word characters
            before ''ge'' (to avoid matching words that are only ''ge'').

            - Append ''ge'' at the end inside the word boundary.

            - The regex becomes: \b[\w''-]+ge\b

            - Apply the case-insensitive flag (?i) to match words ending with any
            case combination of ''ge''.


            Step 3: Usage

            - Use a search method (not full match) on each line to check if any substring
            matches the regex.

            - This returns lines containing at least one word ending with ''ge''.


            Step 4: Edge cases and assumptions

            - Punctuation attached to words (e.g., ''age,'' or ''college.'') will
            still match because the trailing punctuation is beyond the word boundary.

            - Hyphenated or contraction words like "edge-case" or "college''s" will
            match if the ending suffix fits the regex because \b detects word boundaries
            properly.

            - Words exactly ''ge'' are excluded as we require at least one character
            before ''ge''.


            Step 5: Examples

            - "The college is large." Matches "college".

            - "I love the edge-case scenarios." Matches "edge-case".

            - "She said ''rage!'' loudly." Matches "rage".

            - "Watch the ge." Does NOT match, as word ''ge'' is too short.

            substring ''rst'' within a line. This includes ''rst'' appearing as a
            standalone word or as part of a larger word (e.g., ''restart'', ''first'').


            To find lines containing ''rst'', this regex should be applied to each
            line individually. For example, by splitting the input text into lines
            and checking if each line contains a match of ''rst''. Alternatively,
            in programming languages or tools that support multiline input, the regex
            can be used with multiline mode enabled (e.g., the ''m'' flag), but since
            ''rst'' matches any position in the line, no anchors are necessary.


            The matching as provided is case-sensitive, so it will only match lowercase
            ''rst''. If case-insensitive matching is required to also find ''Rst'',
            ''RST'', or other variants, a case-insensitive flag (like ''i'') should
            be enabled.


            No line anchors (^ or $) are included because the goal is to find lines
            that contain ''rst'' anywhere, not lines that are exactly ''rst''.


            Example:

            Input lines:

            - "This is the first line."

            - "Restart the system."

            - "No match here."

            - "The RST protocol."


            Using regex ''rst'' case-sensitive:

            - Matches lines 1 and 2 because they contain ''rst'' in ''first'' and
            ''Restart'' (partial match, but case matters, so ''Restart'' would not
            match because of the capital ''R''). However, actually the first line
            contains ''first'' (with ''rst'' lowercase), so it matches; ''Restart''
            starts with capital ''R'', so no match unless case-insensitive.


            Therefore, to match all case variants, use case-insensitive matching.


            In summary, the regex ''rst'' suffices for matching lines containing the
            substring ''rst'' in a case-sensitive manner; use appropriate flags or
            processing to handle case-insensitivity and line-by-line matching depending
            on context.'

      - output:
          reasoning: 'The task is to find all lines that contain the substring ''rst''.
            The simplest regex to achieve this is ''rst'', which matches the characters
            ''r'', ''s'', ''t'' in exactly that order anywhere within a line.


            Context and usage:

            - In tools like grep (default case-sensitive), using `grep ''rst'' filename`
            will print all lines containing ''rst''.

            - In Python''s `re` module, `re.search(''rst'', line)` finds this substring
            anywhere in a given line.


            Case sensitivity:

            - This regex is case-sensitive and will match ''rst'' exactly in lowercase.

            - For case-insensitive matching, tools and languages often support flags:
            e.g., `grep -i ''rst''` or in Python `re.search(''rst'', line, re.IGNORECASE)`.


            Multiline input:

            - If input contains multiple lines, applying this regex line-by-line will
            correctly identify lines with ''rst''.

            - The regex itself does not include anchors and matches ''rst'' as a substring
            anywhere in the line.


            Examples of matching lines:

            - "first line" (contains ''rst'')

            - "restart the system"


            Examples of non-matching lines:

            - "start the test" (does not contain ''rst'')

            - "Rest is important" (uppercase ''R'' at start; case-sensitive match
            will not find lowercase ''rst'')


            Additional notes:

            - If whole word matching for ''rst'' were desired, word boundary anchors
            (e.g., `\brst\b`) would be necessary.

            - Since the requirement is substring matching anywhere in a line, the
            regex ''rst'' suffices.'

          reasoning: 'The user wants to find lines that include the substring ''rst''.
            To address the feedback, I assume usage in a typical text-search context
            such as grep or a programming language like Python. The regex pattern
            is simply ''rst'' because the substring can appear anywhere within the
            line; thus, no anchors (^ or $) are needed.


            To handle case insensitivity (e.g., matching ''RST'', ''rSt'', etc.),
            I included the inline case-insensitive flag ''(?i)''. This allows the
            pattern to match ''rst'' regardless of letter case.


            Example usage:

            - In Python: re.search(r''(?i)rst'', line) returns True if the line contains
            ''rst'' in any case.

            - In grep: grep -i ''rst'' filename


            This regex will match any occurrence of ''rst'' anywhere in a line. Multiple
            occurrences within a line are naturally matched if searching globally.


            No special handling for leading/trailing whitespace or line boundaries
            is needed since the requirement is to find lines containing ''rst'' anywhere

          reasoning: 'To match lines that contain the substring ''rst'', the regex
            pattern itself is simply ''rst'', which looks for this sequence anywhere
            in the line. However, depending on context and tool, additional considerations
            apply:


            1. **Context:** For example, if using the Unix `grep` command, you can
            search lines containing ''rst'' by running `grep ''rst'' filename`. This
            prints entire lines where ''rst'' appears anywhere.


            2. **Matching entire lines:** The pattern ''.*rst.*'' matches entire lines
            that include ''rst'', but is usually unnecessary because many tools like
            `grep` inherently show full matching lines when searching for ''rst''.


            3. **Case Sensitivity:** If you need to match ''rst'' case-insensitively
            (e.g., ''Rst'' or ''RST''), use flags or modifiers accordingly. In `grep`,
            use `grep -i ''rst'' filename`. In regular expressions supporting inline
            flags, use `(?i)rst`.


            4. **Programming Languages:** In Python, to extract lines containing ''rst''
            case-sensitively, you can do:


            ```python

            import re

            pattern = re.compile(''rst'')

            lines = [...]

            matching_lines = [line for line in lines if pattern.search(line)]

            ```


            For case-insensitive matching, use `re.compile(''rst'', re.IGNORECASE)`.


            5. **Edge Cases:** Lines with multiple occurrences or with ''rst'' anywhere
            (beginning, middle, end) are all matched by ''rst'' substring search.


            **Example:** Given text lines:

            ```

            frostrising

            restart

            history

            RST

            best

            ```


            - `grep ''rst''` matches lines 1 (''frostrising'') and 2 (''restart'').

            - `grep -i ''rst''` also matches line 4 (''RST'').


            Thus, using ''rst'' as the regex pattern is sufficient when applied as
            a substring search within lines, and additional flags or tool options
            handle case sensitivity and output of full lines.'

          reasoning: 'The improved regex ''\bga\w*\b'' matches any word that starts
            with ''ga''. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning and improvements:


            1. Simplified the pattern by removing ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' anchors because
            most regex search functions scan within the string by default and do not
            require anchoring to start or end of the line.


            2. Used single backslashes (e.g., ''\b'' for word boundary and ''\w''
            for word characters) assuming typical regex syntax in many programming
            languages. If double backslashes are needed for string escaping in a specific
            language, they should be added accordingly.


            3. Added word boundaries ''\b'' at the start and end to ensure matching
            only whole words beginning with ''ga'', preventing partial matches inside
            longer words.


            4. Recommended using the case-insensitive flag (often ''i'') in the regex
            engine to match all case variations such as ''Ga'', ''GA'', or ''gA''.
            For example, in JavaScript: `/\bga\w*\b/i`.


            5. Examples of matching words include ''gate'', ''garage'', ''gather'',
            and ''GAme''. Words that don''t start with ''ga'' (like ''bag'', ''stag'',
            ''gala'' (matches), ''gaze'') are considered based on the starting letters.


            6. Word boundaries handle punctuation properly, so words like ''garage,''
            or ''(gate)'' will still be matched without capturing punctuation.


            This regex, combined with the case-insensitive flag, efficiently identifies
            lines containing words starting with ''ga'' in any case variation.'
          regex: \bga\w*\b
        score: 0.0
      - output:
          reasoning: 'This regex matches any word starting with ''ga'' within a line.


            1. The pattern uses ''\b'' to indicate word boundaries. A word boundary
            ensures that ''ga'' appears at the start of a word, preventing matches
            inside other words. For example, it matches ''gap'' but not ''stag''.


            2. ''ga'' specifies the required starting characters of the word.


            3. ''\w*'' matches zero or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores)
            following ''ga''.


            4. The second ''\b'' ensures the word ends after these characters.


            5. We omit ''^'' and ''$'' anchors because the goal is to check if the
            line contains such a word anywhere, not to match the entire line.


            6. To handle uppercase variants like ''Ga'' or ''GA'', the regex engine
            should apply a case-insensitive flag (e.g., /i in many languages).


            7. Note: This pattern assumes words are composed of word characters as
            defined by ''\w''. If words may include hyphens or apostrophes, the pattern
            or approach should be adjusted accordingly.


            Overall, ''\bga\w*\b'' with case-insensitive matching is a concise and
            effective pattern to find words beginning with ''ga'' inside a line.'

            \ reasoning:\n1. To match any line containing a word that begins with\

            \ since word boundaries exclude punctuation, so 'game,' or 'garden.' still\

            or ''ong'' anywhere within them, not specifically to extract words containing
            those substrings.


            Therefore, a simple regex pattern `(ent|ong)` suffices. This pattern matches
            any occurrence of ''ent'' or ''ong'' anywhere in a line.


            For example, when using it with a tool like `grep` or Python''s `re.search`,
            it will return True for lines containing these substrings, regardless
            of their position or surrounding characters.


            If the goal were to extract words containing ''ent'' or ''ong'', a different
            pattern would be needed, but since the intent is to match entire lines
            containing these substrings, `(ent|ong)` is simpler and more effective.


            Usage example in Python:

            ```python

            import re

            pattern = re.compile(r''(ent|ong)'')

            This demonstrates matching lines containing either substring.

            \ goal is to identify entire lines that contain at least one word ending\
            \ with the letters 'y' or 'i', regardless of case.\n\n1. Word Matching:\n\
            \   - To match words that end with 'y' or 'i', we use the regex pattern\
            \ '\\b[a-z]*[yi]\\b'.\n   - Here, '\\b' ensures word boundaries.\n   -\
            \ '[a-z]*' matches zero or more alphabetic characters (excluding digits\
            \ and underscores) to avoid matching names with digits or underscores.\n\
            \   - '[yi]' matches either 'y' or 'i' as the final character.\n\n2. Case\
            \ Insensitivity:\n   - The '(?i)' prefix makes the entire pattern case-insensitive,\
            \ thereby matching words ending with uppercase or lowercase 'Y' or 'I'.\n\
            \n3. Line Matching:\n   - To identify lines containing such words, you\

            \  - Adjusting for such cases would require more complex regex or preprocessing.\n\

            - Only alphabetic words should be matched (no digits or underscores).\n\
            - Case-insensitive matching is required for the last letter.\n- Single-letter\

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Clarify the Objective

            The goal is to identify entire lines containing words that end with the
            letter ''y'' or ''i'', regardless of case (i.e., matching ''y'', ''Y'',
            ''i'', or ''I''). Furthermore, words may contain apostrophes or hyphens,
            so these characters should be included in the word character set.


            Step 2: Define Word Characters

            Typical word characters \w correspond to letters, digits, and underscore.
            Since words can include apostrophes and hyphens, extend the character
            set to `[\w''-]` to cover letters, digits, underscore, apostrophe (''),
            and hyphen (-).


            Step 3: Build the Word-Ending Pattern

            Match words ending with ''y'' or ''i'' (also uppercase due to case-insensitivity).
            We use `[\w''-]*[yi]` to ensure the word ends with ''y'' or ''i''. Wrapping
            this with word boundaries `\b` ensures full words are matched.


            Step 4: Match Entire Lines Containing Such Words

            To extract entire lines containing these words, the regex matches from
            start `^` to end `$` of line, with `.*` before and after the matching
            word. The pattern is `^.*\b[\w''-]*[yi]\b.*$`.


            Step 5: Case-Insensitive Flag

            Use the inline flag `(?i)` at the start of the regex for case-insensitive
            matching.


            Step 6: Usage Example

            - To extract matching lines from a file using command-line tools like
            grep: `grep -iE "\b[\w''-]*[yi]\b" filename.txt`

            - The provided regex can be adapted for programming languages accordingly.


            Example Test Cases:

            - Matching words: ''party'', "Hawai''i", ''ski'', "fly-by"

            - Lines containing these words will be fully matched.

            \ `[a-zA-Z]h` matches substrings where a letter is followed by the lowercase\
            \ letter 'h'. When applying this regex to lines, any line containing at\
            \ least one such substring will be matched.\n\n2. **Case Sensitivity:**\n\
            \   Since 'h' can be uppercase or lowercase, the regex should be case-insensitive.\
            \ To handle this, we can either write `[a-zA-Z][hH]` or better use a case-insensitive\
            \ flag `(i)`. Using the case-insensitive flag makes `[a-z][h]` match letters\

            \ and Unicode:**\n   The problem scope is not explicitly about Unicode\

            \ either 'h' or 'H'.\n\n2. Pattern Explanation: '[a-z]' matches any single\
            \ letter (a-z), and directly after it, 'h' matches the letter 'h' (case-insensitive\
