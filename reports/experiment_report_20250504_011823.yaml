            This means ''Beaker'' should be matched as a whole word, not as a substring
            within another word.


            Step 2: To match the exact word, we use the word boundary anchors \b around
            ''Beaker'', resulting in \bBeaker\b.


            Step 3: Since the word can appear anywhere in the line, we allow any characters
            before and after it. This is done by using .* before and after the word.


            Step 4: We want to match the entire line that contains ''Beaker'', so
            we include ^ and $ at the start and end to match the full line.


            Putting it all together, our regex becomes: ^.*\bBeaker\b.*$'

          reasoning: To match lines that contain the exact word 'Beaker', we need
            to ensure word boundaries to avoid partial matches like 'Beakers' or 'Beakerman'.
            Using \b before and after 'Beaker' ensures the match is the full word
            only. The pattern ^.* and .* $ allow any characters before and after the
            word in the line, so the entire line is matched if it contains 'Beaker'
            as a standalone word anywhere. Thus, the regex ^.*\bBeaker\b.*$ matches
            any line containing 'Beaker' as a full word.

            1. The regex ''^.*'' matches any characters from the start of the line.

          reasoning: The problem is to find lines containing words that end with 'la'.
            A word that ends with 'la' can be represented with the regex pattern \b\w*la\b,
            where \b means word boundary, \w* means zero or more word characters (letters,
            digits, underscore), and 'la' is the suffix we want. To check if a line
            contains such a word, we can use a positive lookahead (?=.*\b\w*la\b)
            that ensures there is at least one word ending with 'la' somewhere in
            the line. The overall regex matches the entire line (^.*$), but requires
            that condition with the lookahead before matching the line. This ensures

            Step 3: The word ending with ''la'' can be matched using word boundaries
            and word characters. The pattern \b matches a word boundary.

            Step 4: The words ending with ''la'' can be represented as \w*la\b, where

            is the literal suffix.

            Step 3: To enforce that the line contains at least one such word, we use

            Step 5: Regarding ''Beaker-Beaker'', since ''-'' is a non-word character,
            \b before and after ''Beaker'' counts as word boundaries, so ''Beaker''
            is matched twice there. However, since the user wants lines with ''Beaker''
            as a word, hyphenated words with ''Beaker'' separated by punctuation are
            considered valid matches. If ''Beaker-Beaker'' should not match, because

            1. The original regex ''^.*min.*imal.*$'' matches lines where ''min''
            appears before ''imal'', including substrings like ''minimal'' where ''min''
            and ''imal'' overlap.


            2. The user is concerned about overlapping substrings (e.g., ''minimal''
            where ''min'' and ''imal'' overlap) and wants to clarify whether this
            should be allowed. Since the user''s statement is ambiguous but they want
            distinct ''min'' before ''imal'', we will ensure ''min'' occurs before
            ''imal'' in the line in a non-overlapping way.


            3. To do this, we can use a positive lookahead pattern to enforce order
            strictly.


            4. Using a lookahead like ''^(?=.*min)(?=.*imal)'' only guarantees both
            substrings exist anywhere but not order. Therefore, we must ensure ''min''
            is before ''imal''.


            5. One approach is to use: ''^.*min.*imal.*$'' with a non-greedy match
            to prevent matching the last ''imal'' too far in the line. However, this
            still allows overlapping matches.


            6. To avoid overlaps, consider the use of lookahead: ''^(?=.*min)(?=.*imal)(?=.*min.*imal)''
            ensures ''min'' and ''imal'' both appear and ''min'' precedes ''imal''.


            7. Since the user also noted that anchoring with ''^'' and ''$'' may be
            unnecessarily restrictive, but here it still makes sense to match the
            entire line.


            8. To avoid matching ''minimal'' where ''min'' and ''imal'' overlap (which
            is effectively the same word), the regex alone cannot fully enforce this
            without complex lookaround or word boundary logic. The user did not clarify
            if ''min'' and ''imal'' must be whole words or unit substrings.


            9. Assuming substrings are okay but should not overlap, our regex ensures
            order by ''(?=.*min.*imal)''.


            10. Therefore, the provided regex ensures both substrings exist and that
            ''min'' occurs before ''imal'' without simplistically matching overlap.


            If further restrictions are needed such as separate words or word boundaries,
            the regex can be adjusted with ''\b'' boundaries, but this was not explicitly
            requested.'

          reasoning: "Step 1: Clarify the requirement regarding substrings:\n- We\
            \ want to match lines where the substring 'min' appears before the substring\
            \ 'imal'.\n- To avoid matching the overlapping substrings as in the word\
            \ 'minimal' (where 'min' and 'imal' overlap), we treat 'min' and 'imal'\
            \ as separate words or substrings bounded by word boundaries (\\b). This\
            \ means 'min' and 'imal' should be separate entities, not overlapping\
            \ parts of a longer word.\n\nStep 2: Case sensitivity:\n- The problem\
            \ statement did not specify case sensitivity, so this regex assumes case-sensitive\
            \ matching. For case-insensitive matching, an inline modifier or regex\
            \ flag would be needed, e.g., (?i).\n\nStep 3: Use of anchors:\n- The\
            \ anchors ^ and $ specify that the regex applies to the entire line, matching\
            \ full lines only.\n\nStep 4: Regex construction details:\n- (?=.*\\bmin\\\
            b) ensures the line contains the word 'min'.\n- (?=.*\\bimal\\b) ensures\
            \ the line contains the word 'imal'.\n- (?=.*\\bmin\\b.*\\bimal\\b) ensures\
            \ 'min' appears before 'imal' in the line.\n- The final .* allows the\
            \ entire line to match once these conditions are met.\n\nStep 5: Examples:\n\
            - Matches:\n  - \"The min value is less than the imal value\"\n  - \"\
            Here min comes first and then imal\"\n- Does not match:\n  - \"minimal\
            \ conditions\" (because 'min' and 'imal' overlap within one word)\n  -\
            \ \"The imal comes before min\"\n\nThis approach ensures that 'min' and\
            \ 'imal' are distinct substrings occurring in order, not overlapping parts\
            \ of the same word.\n\nIf case-insensitive matching is desired, add the\
            \ inline modifier at the start: (?i)^...$"

          reasoning: "The original problem asks to match lines where the substring\

            \ both), then removing line anchors '^' and '$' simplifies the regex while\

        score: 0.0
      - output:
          reasoning: 'The goal is to match entire lines where the substring ''min''
            appears before the substring ''imal''. It''s important to clarify that
            ''min'' and ''imal'' may overlap within a word such as ''minimal''. This
            regex matches such cases because it searches for ''min'' followed at some
            later position by ''imal'', regardless of overlap or separation.


            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. ''^'' anchors the match to the start of the line.

            2. ''.*'' allows any characters before the first substring.

            3. ''min'' matches the literal substring ''min''.

            4. ''.*'' allows any characters (including zero) between ''min'' and ''imal''.

            5. ''imal'' matches the literal substring ''imal''.

            6. ''.*'' allows any characters after ''imal'' to the end of the line.

            7. ''$'' anchors the match to the end of the line.


            Because ''min'' and ''imal'' can overlap (as in ''minimal''), this regex
            is suitable when overlapping substrings are acceptable. If you require
            ''min'' and ''imal'' to be distinct or bounded by word boundaries, the
            regex would need to be adjusted accordingly.


            Thus, this regex matches entire lines containing ''min'' appearing before
            ''imal'', including in overlapping scenarios like ''minimal''. The anchors
            ^ and $ ensure a full-line match as requested.'
