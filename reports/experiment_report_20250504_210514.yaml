            The given counterexample 'abc def' should not match, since 'abc' appears
            before 'def'. The regex '^.*def.*abc.*$' matches lines where 'def' comes
            before 'abc', anywhere in the line, which correctly excludes 'abc def'.
            It ensures that at some point 'def' appears, and then after it 'abc' appears
            later. Therefore, this regex satisfies the requirement and correctly handles
            the edge case.

            Step 3: The edge cases reveal that cases like ''def xyz abc'' should not

            ''defabc'' as a contiguous substring with no characters in between.

            1. Added the inline case-insensitive modifier `(?i)` at the start of the
            regex.

            2. This modifier ensures that ''lay'' and ''lie'' are matched regardless
            of letter casing, covering uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case variations.

            3. The rest of the regex remains the same: using lookahead `(?=.*\blay\b|\blie\b)`
            to assert the presence of ''lay'' or ''lie'' as whole words anywhere in
            the line.

            we want to be confident that either ''lay'' or ''lie'' is found as a whole
            word anywhere in the line.


            This updated regex uses multiple positive lookaheads to cover these cases:


            - ''^(?=.*\blay\b)(?=.*\blie\b).*$'' matches lines that contain both ''lay''

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. We want full line matching, so we anchor with ''^'' at the start and
            ''$'' at the end.

            2. The pattern ''def.*abc'' matches ''def'' followed by any characters
            (including none) and then ''abc''.

            3. Surround with ''.*'' on both sides to allow any characters before ''def''
            and after ''abc'', so the full regex is ''^.*def.*abc.*$''.


            This regex works as follows:

            - It requires at least one occurrence of ''def'', followed later in the
            line (not necessarily immediately) by ''abc''.

            - It matches the entire line.


            Additional notes:

            - It only requires one ''def'' before one ''abc'', regardless of multiple
            occurrences.

            - Case sensitivity depends on how the regex is used; adding the ''re.IGNORECASE''
            flag in Python would make it case-insensitive.


            Example matches:

            - ''xyz def 123 abc''  (matches)

            - ''defabc'' (matches, since ''def'' then ''abc'' immediately after)

            - ''abc def'' (does not match, because ''abc'' appears before ''def'')

            - ''def xyz'' (does not match, no ''abc'' after)


            If order is not important and only presence is required, then lookaheads
            like ''(?=.*def)(?=.*abc)'' can be used, but they do not enforce order.

            This regex is simple and efficient enough for most cases. While '.*' is\
            \ greedy, it is necessary here to account for any characters between 'def'\
            \ and 'abc'. The regex engine finds the earliest 'def' and subsequently\
            \ looks for an 'abc' after it.\n\n**Multiple occurrences:** If there are\
            \ multiple 'def's and 'abc's, the regex matches as long as there exists\
            \ at least one 'def' followed later by at least one 'abc'. For example,\
            \ in 'abc def foo abc def', the regex matches because the second 'abc'\
            \ after the first 'def' satisfies the condition.\n\nIf more granular extraction\
            \ or capturing groups are needed, the regex can be adapted, but for matching\
            \ lines where 'abc' occurs after 'def', '^.*def.*abc.*$' is concise and\
            \ effective."

          reasoning: The goal is to match lines that contain the words 'lay' or 'lie'
            as whole words, regardless of case (so that 'Lay', 'lie', 'LIE', etc.
            are matched). A simple regex with word boundaries around the alternation
            '\b(lay|lie)\b' suffices. Including the inline case-insensitive modifier
            '(?i)' at the start ensures case-insensitive matching. Since many tools
            apply regex per line by default, anchors '^' and '$' are unnecessary.
            This approach is simpler, more efficient, and compatible with regex engines
            that support inline modifiers without needing lookaheads.

          reasoning: 'The user wants to match entire lines containing the words ''lay''
            or ''lie'' as whole words. Using the regex ''\b(lay|lie)\b'' directly
            matches these whole words anywhere in the line. To match the entire line
            containing these words, the pattern anchors at start (^) and end ($),
            and includes ''.*'' to allow any characters before or after the target
            word. The ''(?i)'' inline modifier at the start makes the match case-insensitive,
            so variations like ''Lay'' or ''LIE'' are also matched.


            This approach is simpler and clearer than using a positive lookahead.
            It preserves word boundaries to prevent partial matches (e.g., it won''t
            match ''player'' or ''belie'').


            Example matches:

            - ''I will lay the book on the table.'' (matches ''lay'')

            - ''He decided to lie down.'' (matches ''lie'')

            - ''LAY your cards on the table.'' (case-insensitive match)

            - ''Playing the game is fun.'' (no match, ''Playing'' is not ''lay'' or
            ''lie'').


            If the user wants to match word forms like ''lying'', ''lied'', or ''lays'',
            the regex can be adjusted accordingly upon clarification.'

          reasoning: 'The user''s requirement is to match lines containing the words
            ''lay'' or ''lie''. The previous solution used anchors and lookahead,
            which is more complex than needed.


            Improvements made:

            - Simplified regex to ''\b(lay|lie)\b'' which directly matches the target
            words as whole words.

            - Added the inline case-insensitive modifier ''(?i)'' at the start to
            match ''Lay'', ''LIE'', or any case variation.


            Regarding line matching:

            - Since the user wants to find lines that use these words, the regex should
            match anywhere in the line; thus, no anchors or lookaheads are needed.


            Example tests:

            - Matches: ''I will lie here.'', ''They will lay eggs.'', ''LAY down your
            arms.''

            - Does not match: ''lays'', ''lies'', ''relay'', as word boundaries prevent
            partial matches.


            This approach is simple, clear, and effective for matching full lines
            containing the exact words ''lay'' or ''lie'' in any case.'

            `(?=.*\b(lay|lie)\b)` to assert that somewhere in the line these words
            appear. Then we match the entire line by `.*`. The ^ and $ anchors ensure
            we match the full line as required. This regex thus matches lines containing
            either the word 'lay' or 'lie' anywhere in the line.

          reasoning: To match lines containing the words 'lay' or 'lie' as whole words,
            the regex uses word boundaries (\b) around the alternatives 'lay' and
            'lie' to prevent matching substrings (e.g., 'relay'). The pattern '.*\b(lay|lie)\b.*'
            matches any line that includes either word anywhere. Anchors ^ and $ ensure
            the entire line is matched. The inline modifier '(?i)' at the beginning
            makes the matching case-insensitive, so words like 'Lay' or 'LIE' will
            also match. A lookahead is not necessary here because the entire line
            is matched directly. This regex handles lines with multiple occurrences
            and excludes lines where 'lay' or 'lie' appear as parts of other words.
