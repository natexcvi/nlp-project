            Since the entire line should consist solely of such words, possibly separated

            occurrences of \b[gG]\w*\b.

            Step 5: To match entire lines, ensure the regex matches the whole line:

            Step 2: Decide on pattern boundaries: Since the whole line should be checked,

            contain words starting with letter ''g''. So we need the entire line to
            consist entirely of such words.


            Step 2: Use word boundaries \b around each word. Each word begins with
            ''g'' or ''G'', so [gG][a-zA-Z]* matches a word starting with ''g'' followed
            by letters only.


            Step 3: The user points out punctuation attached to words should be handled.
            To do this, after the word boundary, allow optional punctuation marks
            (like !, ., ,, etc.). We use [[:punct:]]* to match zero or more punctuation
            characters.


            Step 4: Words may be separated by spaces, so after each word (and optional
            punctuation) allow for zero or more spaces \s*.


            Step 5: We repeat this pattern for all words on the line, from start (^)
            to end ($). The non-capturing group (?:...) repeated one or more times
            (+) expresses that.


            Step 6: This regex matches lines where every token is a word starting
            with ''g'' (case-insensitive), possibly followed by punctuation, and separated
            by spaces.


            Example:

            - "gloriously great!" would match because both "gloriously" and "great"
            are words starting with ''g'', "great" ends with "!" which is handled.

            - "Go get the yellow garden gloves" would not match because "the" and
            "yellow" do not start with ''g''.

            should cause the line to not match.


            Step 1: Words must begin with ''g'' or ''G''. So start each word pattern
            with [gG].


            Step 2: Words should only contain letters (assuming this from the examples),

            Step 5: This pattern excludes words with punctuation because punctuation
            is not matched by [a-zA-Z]*; for example, ''go!'' fails because ''!''

            1. Case-insensitive matching is required, so both ''Z'' and ''z'' at word
            start should be considered. The inline modifier (?i) at the start handles
            this.

            2. The line should match if it contains at least one word starting with
            ''z'' or ''Z''. Other words in the line can be anything.

            3. Words starting with ''z'' may have attached apostrophes, such as "zulu''s".
            So allow a word to have an apostrophe inside after the initial ''z'' and
            subsequent letters.

            4. Punctuation aside from apostrophes is not clearly defined, but example
            "z!" implies a word with ''z'' and an attached ''!'' might be considered
            a separate token. Since ''\b'' word boundaries typically exclude punctuation,
            the regex accounts for word boundaries around the ''z'' word.


            Therefore:

            - (?i) makes regex case-insensitive.

            - .* allows any characters before and after.

            - \b ensures word boundary.

            Step 2: To include Unicode letters, we replace \w with \p{L}, which matches
            any kind of letter from any language, improving internationalization.


            Step 3: Each word is defined as starting with a word boundary (\b), followed

            word boundary.


            Step 4: To avoid matching trailing spaces, the line starts with one such
            word: (?:\b[gG]\p{L}*\b)

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Clarify word definition: words must consist exclusively
            of alphabetic characters and start with ''g'' or ''G''. So `\w` (which
            includes digits and underscores) is replaced with `[a-zA-Z]*` to match
            only letters following the initial ''g'' or ''G''.


            Step 2: Carefully handle spacing: replace `\s*` (zero or more spaces)
            with explicit space separators between words using ` +` (one or more spaces).
            This avoids words merging without spaces.


            Step 3: Match one or more words in the line:

            - The first word: `[gG][a-zA-Z]*`

            - Additional words (if any) come after one or more spaces: `(?: +[gG][a-zA-Z]*)*`


            Step 4: Use anchors `^` and `$` to ensure full line match.


            Step 5: This approach disallows trailing spaces at the end because trailing
            spaces would break the pattern since it expects a word after spaces or
            end of line.


            Step 6: Punctuation is not handled here; lines with punctuation will not
            match as requested. To include punctuation, pre-processing or more complex
            patterns would be needed, but the current requirement excludes punctuation
            from words.


            Example matches:

            - "goose giraffe"

            - "Giant gorilla"


            Non-matches:

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Allow leading and trailing whitespace in the line using
            ^\s* at the start and \s*$ at the end of the regex to ignore any spaces
            or tabs before the first word and after the last word.


            Step 2: Focus on matching words beginning with ''z'' or ''Z''. The problem
            states words beginning with ''z'' but to be case insensitive, assume only
            lowercase ''z'' as specified. If uppercase ''Z'' is needed, we can add
            case insensitivity flag. Here, the regex explicitly uses ''z''.


            Step 3: Match each word starting with ''z'' followed by zero or more word
            characters using ''z\w*''. This allows matching single-letter words like
            ''z'', which seems acceptable.


            Step 4: Use \b after the word to ensure word boundary, so that trailing
            punctuation is excluded and does not interfere with recognition.


            Step 5: Separate words by single spaces only ('' +'') to be precise and
            prevent tabs or other whitespace characters between words, as per the
            feedback.


            Step 6: The entire sequence of one or more such words is captured inside
            a non-capturing group (?:...) and repeated with a ''+'' quantifier to
            match at least one such word.


            Step 7: The optional trailing spaces after the last word before end-of-line
            are matched with \s*$.


            Step 8: This pattern will not match lines with punctuation attached to
            words (e.g., commas or periods right after words) since \b matches word
            boundaries but punctuation breaks word boundaries, so this is consistent
            with the clarified requirement.


            Additional notes:

            - The regex allows lines with multiple words all starting with ''z'',
            separated by single spaces.

            - Lines composed only of spaces or empty lines won''t match because the
            group requires at least one word.

            - The regex uses explicit spaces between words and does not accept tabs
            or other whitespace for separation, as requested.

            - Case sensitivity: The regex only matches lowercase ''z'' to start the
            word, if uppercase is needed, a case-insensitive flag ''(?i)'' can be
            added at the start.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "zebra zone zoom"

            - Matches: "  zebra   zen  " (leading and trailing spaces and multiple
            spaces between words would fail because we require single spaces, so this
            could be adjusted if more flexible spacing is desired)

            - Does not match: "zip, zap" (comma breaks the \b boundary)

            - Does not match: "apple zebra" (first word does not start with ''z'')


            This refined regex addresses the feedback by allowing leading/trailing
            whitespace, requiring single spaces between words and matching only words
            starting with the letter ''z'', excluding punctuation and tabs as separators.'

            matched with ''^\s*'' and ''\s*$''.

            3. Each word must start with ''z'' or ''Z'' followed by zero or more alphabetic
            letters (a-z or A-Z), disallowing digits, underscores, or other symbols.
            This ensures only valid alphabetic words starting with ''z'' count.

            4. Between words, exactly one or more spaces are required (''\s+''), avoiding
            issues with no spacing or multiple spaces collapsing.

            5. The pattern matches one word starting with ''z'' ([zZ][a-zA-Z]*), then
            zero or more occurrences of one or more spaces plus another such word.

            6. This excludes punctuation since words are strictly alphabetic.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "zebra zip zest", "Zany Zoom", "  zebra  " (leading/trailing
            spaces).

            Step 5: Words are separated by at least one whitespace character (\s+).

            Step 6: The first word with punctuation is matched by (?:\b[zZ]\w*\b[.,!?:;]?).
