      - output:
          reasoning: To match lines that begin with 'Therefore', we start our regex
            with '^Therefore', which asserts the start of the line and then matches
            the word 'Therefore'. The '.*' matches the rest of the line, and '$' ensures
            the match goes to the end of the line.

      - output:
          reasoning: We want to match lines that start with the word 'Therefore'.
            In regex, '^' asserts the start of a line, and 'Therefore' matches the
            literal word. '.*' matches any characters (including none) after 'Therefore',
            and '$' asserts the end of the line. This way, the regex matches the entire
            line only if it starts with 'Therefore'.

      - output:
          reasoning: The regex should match lines that contain 'tain' immediately
            preceded by either 're' or 'per'. So, match any line with 'retain' or
            'pertain' anywhere. The pattern uses (re|per)tain to ensure 'tain' is
            immediately after 're' or 'per'. Wrapping in ^(.*(re|per)tain.*)$ matches
            the entire line that contains such a sequence.
          regex: ^(.*(re|per)tain.*)$

          reasoning: To match lines containing 'tain' after 're' or 'per', I need
            to find the words 'retain' or 'pertain'. Both start with either 're' or
            'per' followed directly by 'tain'. I use the non-capturing group (?:re|per)
            to match either 're' or 'per', followed by 'tain'. Wrapping in \b ensures
            it's a word boundary, so we don't match longer prefixes. The pattern is
            then included anywhere in the line with .* before and after, anchored
            by ^ and $ to match the full line.

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. Use (re|per) to indicate either ''re'' or ''per''.

            2. It must be immediately followed by ''tain'', so combine as (re|per)tain.

            3. To avoid partial word matches, \b (word boundary) is used before and
            after: \b(re|per)tain\b.

            4. To match the full line where this pattern appears, surround with ^.*
            and .*$, as ^.*(pattern).*$ (or just use (.*pattern.*) with line anchors).

            unless 'retain' or 'pertain' stands alone as a word. (?:re|per) matches
            either 're' or 'per'. 'tain' follows immediately. Wrapping in ^.* and

            about "digit ''4'' appearing between digits ''3'' and ''5''", and if we
            only want matches where ''3'', ''4'', and ''5'' are all digits and in
            that order, we can use: ''^.*3.*4.*5.*$'' as the solution. If we don''t
            want any non-digits between them, use ''[^\d]*'', but here I''m keeping
            it general for any character between them.'

            only regex features compatible with most command-line tools (e.g., grep).
            2. We avoid lookbehind, as it is not supported in all regex flavors, particularly
            grep. 3. ([^A-Za-z]|^) matches either the line start or a non-letter,
            ensuring the 6-letter sequence is not preceded by another letter. ([^A-Za-z]|$)
            ensures it is not followed by a letter or matches the line end. 4. [A-Za-z]{6}
            in the middle matches exactly 6 consecutive English letters. If Unicode
            is necessary, [A-Za-z] can be replaced with \p{L}, but that's engine-dependent.
            5. This regex will match anywhere in the line such a sequence exists.
            6. Overlapping sequences (e.g., 'abcdefg') will not match. This will detect
            lines that contain at least one such substring. 7. Wrapping with ^ and
            $ is not needed; most environments (including grep) search within lines,
            not the whole line by default. To simply detect the presence, you can

          reasoning: To ensure that overlapping 'sw' occurrences are counted (e.g.,
            'swswsw' should count as three), we use a lookahead. The expression (?=(?:.*?sw){3,})
            asserts that at least three 'sw' sequences exist from the start of the
            line, allowing for overlaps (since the lookahead does not consume input).
            The rest of the line can be anything (.*), ensuring the entire line is
            matched. This addresses the previous regex's limitation of only counting
            non-overlapping matches, ensures clarity, maintains simplicity, and works
            in most regex engines that support lookaheads.

      - output:
          reasoning: The requirement is to match any full line that contains at least
            three occurrences of the sequence 'sw'. The improved regex uses a non-capturing
            group (?:[^\n]*sw) to represent any number of non-newline characters followed
            by 'sw'. By requiring this group to appear at least three times ({3,}),
            we ensure there are at least three 'sw' sequences in the line. The regex
            is anchored with ^ and $ to match the entire line. This approach is both
            readable and efficient, avoiding the pitfalls of greediness or backtracking
            from the initial proposal.

          reasoning: The earlier regex incorrectly allowed non-consecutive 's' and
            'w'. Here, we require three or more literal 'sw' sequences in the line.
            (?:[^\n]*sw) matches any sequence of characters (except newlines) up to
            and including a 'sw' substring. Repeating this three or more times ensures
            there are at least 3 occurrences of 'sw'. Anchors ^ and $ make sure the
            entire line is matched. This pattern does not match overlapping 'sw's,
            as standard regex engines don't count overlapping matches, which is the
            typical expectation. The solution is robust for cases like 'swxxswxxsw'
            and will not match if 's' and 'w' are not consecutive.

      - output:
          reasoning: To address performance and clarity, and to count non-overlapping
            occurrences of 'sw', this regex breaks the whole line into sequences that
            each end with 'sw', allowing three or more 'sw' sequences non-overlappingly.
            The pattern (?:[^\n]*sw){3,} ensures at least three 'sw' in the line,
            potentially with any characters except a newline between them. The anchors
            ^ and $ ensure entire line matching. Overlapping is not counted; e.g.,
            'swsw' only counts two 'sw' matches (as desired). This avoids excessive
            backtracking from the previous '[^\n]*?'.

            separated by other characters. This approach works in most regex engines
            (including POSIX Extended and PCRE) and avoids advanced features such
            as lookahead or non-greedy quantifiers, making it portable and simple.

            escapes ([\p{L}]) to match only alphabetic characters. The pattern \b[\p{L}]{5}\b
            matches any 5-letter alphabetic word with word boundaries on both sides,
            so only pure words of 5 letters (not including digits or underscores)
            will be matched. The pattern is wrapped with .*, so the full line is matched
            if it contains such a word anywhere. The ^ and $ anchors are used to capture
            the full line. The (?m) modifier is added at the start to ensure ^ and
            $ match the start and end of each line in multiline strings. This regex
            depends on Unicode-aware regex engines that support the \p{L} syntax (which

            1. To match three words of exactly four letters each, separated by spaces,
            we want to match exactly three 4-letter sequences with space(s) between
            them and nothing else.

            2. To allow optional leading/trailing whitespace, \s* is used at the start
            and end of the regex.

            3. To allow one or more space characters between words (including tab/other
            whitespace), we replace literal spaces with \s+.

            4. [a-zA-Z]{4} matches exactly four letters for each word. If only English
            letters are valid and the match should be case-sensitive, no ''i'' flag
            is needed. If other letters (e.g., accented) are valid, the character
            class would need to use Unicode properties.

            5. The pattern starts with a word, then (twice) allows \s+ and another
            4-letter word (using a non-capturing group for conciseness), resulting
            in three total words.

            6. The anchors ^ and $ ensure nothing else is present on the line except
            for optional whitespace at either end.


            In summary: This regex matches lines that, after ignoring leading/trailing
            whitespace, contain exactly three words, each with exactly four English
            letters, separated by one or more whitespace characters.'

            leading whitespace, I included \s* after the start anchor (^), which matches
            any number (including zero) of whitespace characters before the phrase.
            The rest of the regex remains the same, matching any characters until
            the end of the line. This solution now matches lines that begin (optionally
            after whitespace) with the phrase 'once upon a time', in any combination

            Step 2: To permit optional leading spaces or tabs (indentation, accidental
            spaces), we start the pattern with ''^\s*'', where ''^'' anchors to the
            start of the line and ''\s*'' matches zero or more whitespace characters.

            Step 3: To ensure the phrase itself is matched exactly (in a case-insensitive
            manner), we use ''once upon a time''.

            common non-word punctuation or spaces do separate words, and apostrophes

            Improvements and considerations:

            1. To avoid matching underscores and digits after the initial ''h'', the
            pattern uses [hH][a-zA-Z]+, ensuring only ASCII letters follow the ''h''.

            2. \b is retained as it''s the most consistent word boundary anchor for
            separating words by whitespace or punctuation, but note: \b may inconsistently
            handle apostrophes (as in contractions) and some non-ASCII or special
            characters depending on engine and locale.

            3. ''honey-hive'' is one word with a hyphen, which is not matched as two
            separate words because word boundaries do not occur within hyphenated
            words according to most regex engines. If required, separate handling
            for hyphens is needed.

            4. The pattern (?:.*\b[hH][a-zA-Z]+\b.*){2,} ensures at least two non-overlapping
            words starting with ''h'' anywhere on the line.

            5. The pattern will match lines where the two ''h'' words are separated
            by punctuation (comma, period, etc), because \b recognizes boundaries
            at most punctuation in Python''s re.

            6. To handle Unicode letters (accents, etc.), replace [a-zA-Z] with \w
            and use re.UNICODE, with the caveat that \w includes digits and underscore;
            refinement may be needed based on requirements.

            5. ''DEF.'' itself should be matched exactly, so we use ''DEF\.'' -- the

            which matches any line that contains the exact substring 'DEF.' at any
            position. There is no need for '^.*' or '.*$', as most regex tools and
            search operations check for substring presence without anchors. If the
            intention is for the entire line to only be 'DEF.', then '^DEF\.$' should

            character. This way, ''DEF.'' is not embedded in a longer word.

            Regarding punctuation: ''\w'' matches letters, digits, and underscores,
            but not apostrophes or non-standard letters, which can split words for
            this regex. For example, in the line: "bru''s plan was cruel", ''bru''s''
            would match only the ''bru'' part as a word (ending at the apostrophe);
            ''cruel'' would match fully. If a different word definition is needed
            (including apostrophes or Unicode letters), the regex would need adjustment.


            Examples of matching lines:

            as a complete word and not as a part of another word (e.g., 'sandwicheater'

            to '^' and '$' or using '.*' at the beginning/end is unnecessary for matching

            i.e., is a letter (including non-ASCII by engine) or another character

            immediately followed by a non-word, digit, or underscore character.\n   -

            start or end with hyphens or apostrophes. If they do, further adjustments
            are needed. Also, the definition of a word is not perfect; more elaborate
            regex or NLP can provide improved accuracy.\n\n*Efficiency note:* The
            pattern does not use ''^.*'' or ''.*$'', which are usually unnecessary

            word boundary works for standard ASCII characters; for full Unicode word
            boundary support, some regex engines may require the UNICODE flag or use
            different boundary constructs. Documenting this, users should be aware
            of these potential limitations for non-English languages. For grep, the
            corresponding flag would be '-i'. This regex will function as intended

            any capitalization. We keep ''\bclue\b'' so only standalone ''clue'' is
            matched, not as a substring in other words. Note: The ''(?i)'' inline
            modifier works in many regex engines (like Python''s re, Perl, and .NET);

            (word boundary) can differ between engines, especially with non-ASCII
            or Unicode input; in environments with full Unicode support, ''\b'' treats
            any Unicode word character as a boundary, but some engines (like legacy
            Python or basic grep) may only treat ASCII characters. If you''re working
