          reasoning: 'Step 1: Understand the requirement: We need to match lines that

            within the line there should be at least one word starting with either
            ''a'' or ''b'' and ending with ''er''.


            Step 2: Define the pattern for such a word: \b[ab]\w*er\b

            - \b : word boundary

            - [ab] : the first letter is ''a'' or ''b''

            Step 3: Since the line should contain at least one such word, we use a
            positive lookahead to check for the presence of the described word anywhere
            in the line: (?=.*\b[ab]\w*er\b)


            Step 4: The regex should match the whole line, so we use ^ and $ to anchor
            the match from start to end: ^(?=.*\b[ab]\w*er\b).*$


            This pattern matches any line that contains at least one word starting

            be matched with the pattern ''\w*er\b'' where ''\w*'' represents any number
            of word characters and ''\b'' ensures the word boundary.


            Step 2: Find words that have the letter ''a'' or ''b'' before the ''er''
            in the word. Specifically, this means the letter immediately before the
            ''er'' ending should be ''a'' or ''b''. This can be represented as ''[ab]er\b''.
            However, since the letter ''a'' or ''b'' can come before the ''er'' but
            not necessarily immediately adjacent, we need to consider the whole word.


            Reconsideration: The phrase ''use the letter ''a'' or ''b'' before words
            ending with ''er'''' could mean the line contains ''a'' or ''b'' prior
            to words that end with ''er'', or the words that end with ''er'' have
            ''a'' or ''b'' before ''er''. The user likely wants lines that contain
            words ending with ''er'' where the character before ''er'' is ''a'' or
            ''b''.


            Step 3: To match a word that ends with ''er'' and has ''a'' or ''b'' immediately
            before ''er'', the regex is ''\b\w*[ab]er\b''.


            Step 4: To match any line containing such a word, wrap with ''^.*'' at
            the start and ''.*$'' at the end for a full line match: ''^.*\b\w*[ab]er\b.*$''.


            This regex matches full lines that contain at least one word ending with

            a word boundary after ''er''.


            Step 2: The line must contain at least one word ending with ''er'' that
            uses ''a'' or ''b'' before that word. This means the word that ends with
            ''er'' must have an ''a'' or ''b'' before it, possibly at any position
            in the word before ''er''.


            Step 3: To check for ''a'' or ''b'' before words ending with ''er'', we
            look for [ab]\w*er\b. This means the word ends with ''er'', and somewhere

            2. The word ''Triple'' should be directly followed by words starting with

            To address this:

            1. Remove word boundaries ''\b'' to allow matching ''code'' as a substring

            Step 1: Identify the pattern ''sw''.

            Step 2: We want at least 3 occurrences of ''sw''. So, ''sw'' repeated
            3 or more times (not necessarily consecutively, but anywhere in the line).

            Step 3: We want to match the whole line that contains these occurrences.


            A simple way with lookahead is to use a positive lookahead that checks
            for ''sw'' at least 3 times anywhere. However, some regex engines don''t
            support counting inside lookaheads.


            Another method is:

            - From the start, allow any characters that don''t start ''s'' (e.g. [^s]*)

            - Then match ''s'' and then any characters not ''w'' ([^w]*) and then
            ''w'', which indicates one occurrence of ''sw'' (possibly with some chars
            between ''s'' and ''w''). But since we need exact ''sw'' sequence, no
            characters allowed in between.


            Actually, for exact ''sw'', we need no characters between s and w, so
            better to match (?:[^s]*sw) to find ''sw''. For at least 3 occurrences,
            we use (?:[^s]*sw){3,}.


            Finally, allow any characters after these matches to complete the line:

            Add start and end anchors: ^ and $


            So the regex becomes:

            Step 4: The pattern \b\w+ne\b matches any word that ends with ''ne'' and
            is longer than ''ne'' alone.

            Step 5: Use ^.* at the start and .*$ at the end to match the entire line
            containing such a word.


            Therefore, the regex ^.*\b\w+ne\b.*$ matches any full line that contains
            at least one word longer than ''ne'' that ends with ''ne''.'

            Step 1: Understand the edge case.

            - Words ending with ''en'' or ''nne'' should not be matched.

            - For example, ''open'' or ''ten'' (end with ''en'') or ''anne'' (end
            with ''nne'') should not count.


            Step 2: How to exclude endings with ''en'' or ''nne''.

            - Words ending with ''ne'' can have the final two letters as ''ne''.

            - To exclude ''en'' and ''nne'', the character before ''ne'' should NOT
            be ''n''.

            - So, for a word ending, the pattern is: zero or more word chars, then
            a character that is not ''n'', then ''ne''.

            - \b (word boundary)

            as word boundaries \b only consider word characters vs non-word characters.
            Since \b doesn''t separate letters from punctuation correctly in all cases
            such as ''Miss,'' or ''This.'', the comma or period immediately after
            the word breaks the word boundary, so the 4-letter word ending with ''s''
            won''t be matched correctly. To handle this, we need to define a word
            boundary that allows for trailing punctuation but still recognizes the
            4-letter word. Using \b[a-zA-Z]{3}s\b matches exactly 4-letter words ending
            with ''s'' using letters only, but we must ensure that punctuation doesn''t
            interfere. Usually, \b works well for letters vs punctuation, so changing
            \w to [a-zA-Z] restricts to letters only which prevents digits or underscores

            word causing the word boundary to correctly detect the words like ''Miss,''
            and ''This.'' as matching words. However, since the user says these should
            not match (in the edge cases), likely because the punctuation immediately
            after should exclude the match, but \b treats punctuation as non-word
            characters, thus ''Miss,'' will still match. Given this, if we need to
            exclude words with trailing punctuation like commas or periods, we need
            a stricter condition: the 4-letter word ending in ''s'' should not be
            attached immediately to punctuation such as '','', ''.'', etc. To do this,
            we can use lookahead to ensure the 4-letter word is followed by either
            whitespace or end of line, not punctuation. For example: \b[a-zA-Z]{3}s(?=\s|$)
            ensures the word is followed by space or end of line. By wrapping this
            in a full line matcher: ^.*\b[a-zA-Z]{3}s(?=\s|$).*$. This will not match
            ''Miss,'' because the comma is not a space or end of line. Same for ''This.''

            Step 2: The problem requires words that truly end with ''ing'', so the

            Step 3: Restrict the word characters to letters only by using ''[a-zA-Z]+''

            Step 4: The pattern ''\b[a-zA-Z]+ing\b'' now matches any word made of

            with ''ing''. The previous regex treated words like ''king'' as matches,
            but ''king'' isn''t a verb or gerund ending with ''ing''.


            Step 1: Identify the requirement of matching words that end with ''ing''
            as a suffix specifically linked to verbs or gerunds.


            Step 2: Since it''s hard to parse English grammar precisely with regex,
            we''ll approximate by requiring that the ''ing'' suffix is attached to
            a verb-like stem, often at least one letter before ''ing'' (excluding
            short words like ''king''). ''king'' is a noun, but ''sing'', ''bring''
            are verbs. However, this is difficult to encode precisely.


            Step 3: To exclude ''king'' while including words like ''singing'', let''s
            consider ''ing'' suffix requiring at least one additional letter before
            ''ing'', so words like ''singing'', ''running'' will match, but ''king''
            will also match since it has letters before ''ing''. To exclude ''king'',
            we need to exclude it explicitly.


            Step 4: Since ''king'' is a common noun that ends with ''ing'', but is
            not a gerund, we can create a negative lookahead to exclude ''king''.
            However, that doesn''t generalize.


            Step 5: Instead, restrict to words ending with ''ing'' with at least two
            characters before ''ing'' that are not ''k''. So the pattern \b\w{3,}ing\b
            ensures minimum length to exclude ''king'' (length 4), but ''king'' would
            still match.

            2. In the example "looking-forward", "looking" is part of a hyphenated
            word, so it should not be matched independently.

            3. Word boundary \b considers only word characters (\w) versus non-word
            characters, so it treats the hyphen as a boundary, which leads to "looking"
            being matched inside "looking-forward", which is not desired.

            4. To fix this, we need to ensure the word ending with ''ing'' is not
            immediately preceded by a word character, hyphen, or apostrophe. Using
            a negative lookbehind (?<![\w-\'']) ensures that the character before
            the match is not a word character, hyphen, or apostrophe.

            5. We keep the trailing word boundary \b after the ''ing'' to ensure the

            5. ''$'' asserts the end of the line.

            - The previous regex considers only lowercase ''c'' correctly because
            it specifically looks for ''c''.


            The examples given:

            - "Chocolate cake" contains uppercase ''C'' and lowercase ''c'' once in
            ''cake''. So only one lowercase ''c'' overall. Since it requires at least

            Step 2: To prevent matching ''Hindi'' when it is part of a longer hyphenated
            word, we need stricter boundaries.

            Step 3: Using negative lookbehind `(?<!\w)` before ''Hindi'' ensures that

      - output:
          reasoning: "The initial regex '^.*\\binoperative\\b.*$' does handle the\
            \ word boundaries appropriately, but to clarify handling punctuation and\
            \ hyphenated words:\n\n1. The word boundary '\\b' matches positions between\
            \ word and non-word characters. In the example 'inoperative-device', the\
            \ hyphen is a non-word character, so '\\binoperative\\b' will not match\
            \ 'inoperative' because the hyphen is considered a non-word character;\
            \ this means 'inoperative' does count as a standalone word before the\
            \ hyphen. However, since the user states that 'inoperative' immediately\
            \ before a hyphen should NOT match (i.e., 'inoperative-device' is considered\
            \ one word), the default '\\b' behavior may incorrectly match this. \n\
            \n2. To prevent matching 'inoperative' when it is part of a hyphenated\
            \ word, we need to ensure that characters adjacent to 'inoperative' are\
            \ not letters or hyphens. That is, the word should be bounded by either\
            \ the start/end of line or by whitespace/punctuation excluding hyphen.\n\
            \n3. The regex '\\binoperative\\b' by itself will treat hyphen as a word\
            \ boundary, so it will match 'inoperative' in 'inoperative-device', which\
            \ we want to avoid.\n\n4. To fix this, define custom boundaries: ensure\
            \ that the character before 'inoperative' is either start of line or a\
            \ non-word/non-hyphen character, and the character after 'inoperative'\
            \ is either end of line or a non-word/non-hyphen character.\n\n5. This\
            \ can be achieved using lookbehind and lookahead assertions:\n   - Use\
            \ '(?<![\\w-])' before 'inoperative' to assert that the previous character\
            \ is NOT a word character or hyphen.\n   - Use '(?![\\w-])' after to assert\
            \ the next character is NOT a word character or hyphen.\n\n6. The regex\
            \ becomes:\n   ^(?=.*(?<![\\w-])inoperative(?![\\w-])).*$\n\nThis pattern\
            \ means: the line contains 'inoperative' as a standalone word not adjacent\
            \ to letters or hyphens.\n\nThis correctly rejects 'inoperative-device'\
            \ because after 'inoperative' is a hyphen, but matches 'Inoperative! The\
            \ system fails.' because the exclamation mark is allowed as non-word and\
            \ non-hyphen.\n\nHence, the final regex is '^(?=.*(?<![\\w-])inoperative(?![\\\
            w-])).*$' which solves the problem."

            \nThis will not match words like '-xray' because before 'x' is '-', which\
            \ violates the lookbehind.\n\nCheck edge cases:\n- 'eduXation' : 'X' is\

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. The initial regex ''^.*\bTriple\s+X\w*.*$'' matches lines containing
            at least one such occurrence anywhere in the line.

            2. However, the user is concerned about lines with multiple occurrences
            and matching the full line that meets the criteria.

            3. Since the user wants to ensure the full line matches the condition
            that every occurrence of ''Triple'' is followed by a word starting with
            ''X''. But the example shows multiple occurrences.


            Given this, the problem is ambiguous: does the line need to match if it
            contains any occurrence of ''Triple'' followed by a word starting with
            ''X'', or if all occurrences of ''Triple'' follow this pattern?


            From the user''s examples, it''s implied the line should be matched if
            it contains any such occurrence.


            Hence, the original regex ''^.*\bTriple\s+X\w*.*$'' should suffice for
            matching the full line string.


            However, to be strictly correct, making sure the ''Triple'' is always
            followed by a word starting with ''X'' in the line is complicated and
            requires lookahead/lookaround which may not be fully possible.


            Given the ambiguity and constraints, we''ll provide a regex that matches
            lines that have one or more occurrences of the pattern ''Triple'' plus
            a following word starting with ''X'', allowing other text in the line.


            Therefore, the regex ''^(?:.*\bTriple\s+X\w*.*)+$'' will match one or
            more occurrences of the pattern anywhere in the line.


            This will ensure lines like ''Triple XYZ and Triple X marks the spot''
            match, as both contain ''Triple'' followed by words starting with ''X''.


            In summary, the regex ensures the line contains one or more occurrences

            Step 5: Note that behavior of ''^'' and ''$'' can vary between tools (e.g.,
            grep, Python, or JavaScript). Using ''@'' alone focuses on the character

            scenarios, but this depends on the regex engine used. To capture all case
            variants such as 'Code' or 'CODE', a case-insensitive flag (usually 'i')
            should be applied during regex matching, rather than embedded in the pattern.
            Regarding hyphenated scenarios like 'code-related', the word boundary
            '\b' treats the hyphen as non-word character, so 'code' in 'code-related'
            is matched correctly as a word separate from the hyphenated suffix. Therefore,
            this regex '\bcode\b' with case-insensitive matching provides an effective
            and concise solution for detecting lines containing the standalone word
            'code' regardless of case.

      - output:
          reasoning: 'The goal is to identify lines containing the word ''code'' as
            a whole word, regardless of case.


            1. Simplification: Using ''^.*\bcode\b.*$'' is unnecessarily complex if
            the regex engine searches line-by-line or supports substring matching.
            Simply using ''\bcode\b'' is sufficient to find the word ''code'' anywhere
            within a line.


            2. Case Sensitivity: The original regex is case-sensitive and won''t match
            ''Code'' or ''CODE''. To account for all case variations, the regex should
            be used with the case-insensitive flag (commonly ''i''). For example,
            in many languages or tools, this means setting the ''i'' flag when compiling
            the regex.


            3. Word Boundaries: ''\b'' ensures that ''code'' is matched as a separate
            word and not as part of another word like ''decode'', ''codes'', or ''codex''.


            4. Multiline Input: Typically, to process multiple lines, the input is
            handled line-by-line or multiline mode is used. Since the regex ''\bcode\b''
            searches for the whole word within a line, processing line-by-line is
            straightforward.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''This is code.'', ''Code is important.'', ''Learn to write
            CODE.''

            - Non-matches: ''decode'', ''codes'', ''codex'', ''coding''


            Summary:

            Use regex ''\bcode\b'' with case-insensitive matching enabled. Depending
            on your environment, enable the ''i'' flag and process input line by line
            or in multiline mode to find all lines containing the word ''code'' in
            any casing.'

          reasoning: 'Step 1: The goal is to match entire lines containing the word
            ''code'' as a standalone word.


            Step 2: Use ''^'' and ''$'' anchors to ensure the entire line is matched.


            Step 3: The pattern ''.*'' before and after ''\bcode\b'' matches any characters
            on the line (except newline).


            Step 4: Use the word boundary ''\b'' around ''code'' to ensure matching
            the whole word and not substrings like ''encode'' or ''codex''. Note that
            ''\b'' matches a position between a word character (letters, digits, underscore)
            and a non-word character.


            Step 5: Add the case-insensitive flag ''(?i)'' at the start to match ''Code'',
            ''CODE'', etc., so case variations are handled.


            Step 6: Regarding multiline inputs, the regex matches each line independently.
            In tools or languages where input is multiline, you should process input
            line-by-line or use multiline modes appropriately.


            Step 7: Performance-wise, ''.*'' is greedy but not problematic here because
            we''re matching per line; for very large inputs or many lines, processing
            line-by-line is efficient.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''code'', ''I wrote some code.'', ''This CODE is neat'', ''A_code_example''
            (note: ''code'' adjacent to underscore counts as word character, so ''A_code_example''
            matches only if ''code'' is separated; here ''code'' is part of a word
            without boundaries, so no match)

            - Does not match: ''encode'', ''codex'', ''scodes''


            Notes:

            - In some environments, word boundaries may treat underscores as word
            characters; if you want to exclude underscores from word characters or
            handle differently, you may need a custom pattern.

            - If the environment does not support inline flags like ''(?i)'', use
            the engine''s case-insensitive option.

            of case (e.g., ''Ki'', ''KI''), the regex should be used with a case-insensitive
            flag (often ''i'').

            Step 2: Case Insensitivity: To match words starting with ''ki'' regardless
            of case (''ki'', ''Ki'', ''KI'', ''kI''), we use the inline case-insensitive
            flag ''(?i)''.


            Step 3: Word boundary ''\b'': Ensures we match the start and end of a
            whole word.


            Step 4: Start with ''ki'': After the word boundary, we match ''ki'' literally.


            Step 5: Following letters: To include accented and Unicode letters (beyond
            ASCII a-zA-Z), we use ''\p{L}'' which matches any Unicode letter. The
            ''*'' means zero or more letters.


            Step 6: Ending with ''\b'' to mark end of word.


            Step 7: We do not anchor the regex with ''^'' or ''$'' because we want

            Step 2: Use word boundaries (\b) to ensure matching whole words only.


            Step 3: To support case-insensitivity, assume the regex engine uses a
            case-insensitive flag or modifier; alternatively, include both uppercase
            and lowercase explicitly.


            Step 4: Replace ASCII-only [a-zA-Z]* with Unicode letter class \p{L}*
            to match letters from any alphabet, including accented and non-Latin characters.


            Step 5: Remove unnecessary anchors (^, $) and leading/trailing .* since
            the line may contain multiple words and tools typically search for the
            pattern within lines.


            Testing edge cases like ''kincaid'', ''Kites'', or ''kilometer'' will
            correctly match:

            - ''Kites'': matches despite uppercase ''K'' if case-insensitive

            - ''kilometer'': matches fully


            Therefore, the regex \bki\p{L}*\b matches any whole word starting with

            1. Removed ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' because anchoring and matching the entire
            line are unnecessary for finding a pattern anywhere in the line. Using

            2. Used ''\b'' to denote word boundaries to ensure we match whole words.


            3. Used ''\w*'' after ''ki'' instead of ''[a-zA-Z]*'' to include Unicode
            word characters (letters, digits, underscore). This handles words with
            apostrophes and other Unicode letters if supported by the regex engine.


            4. The pattern is ''\bki\w*\b'' which matches words starting with ''ki''

            5. To handle case insensitivity (matching ''Ki'', ''KI'', ''kI'', or ''ki''),

            \ matches the entire line.\n\n5. **Why Anchors Are Used:**\n   - Anchoring\
            \ at `^` and `$` ensures matching the entire line, which can be useful\
            \ depending on context.\n   - This is optional if the regex is used in\
            \ a context where substring matches suffice.\n\n6. **Example Test Cases:**\n\
            \   - \"swxswysw\" => Matches (3 occurrences of 'sw').\n   - \"swswsw\"\
            \ => Matches (3 overlapping occurrences: positions 0,2,4).\n   - \"swxsw\"\
            \ => Does NOT match (only 2 occurrences).\n\n7. **Limitations & Notes:**\n\
            \   - Some regex engines may interpret the repeated lookahead differently;\
            \ testing in the target environment is recommended.\n   - This regex is\
            \ more efficient than the original due to non-greedy matching and positive\
            \ lookahead.\n\nIn summary, the regex `^(?=(?:.*?sw)){3}.*$` effectively\
            \ ensures at least 3 occurrences of 'sw', correctly accounting for overlapping\
            \ patterns and improving efficiency."

            - Overlapping occurrences of 'sw' are NOT counted separately (e.g., in\

            \ words:** Instead of only \\w (which matches letters, digits, and underscore),\
            \ include hyphen '-' and apostrophe '\\'' characters inside words to handle\

            \ for words that end with the letters 'en' exactly. The pattern for such\
            \ words is \\b[\\w'-]*en\\b.\n\n  - \\b ensures word boundaries, so punctuation\
            \ adjacent to words (like 'golden,' or 'happen.') will not interfere with\

            part of the word.

            Step 3: To avoid matching ''en'' alone as a word (if undesired), replace
            \w* with \w+ or in this case [a-zA-Z]+, requiring at least one alphabetic
            character before ''en''.

            Step 4: Use word boundaries \b to ensure the end of the word is exactly
            ''en'' and matches full words.

            Step 5: Remove redundant ^.* and .*$ wrappers since the regex will be
            used to scan lines for matches, not necessarily to match the full line.

            Step 6: Address case sensitivity: If matching should be case-insensitive

            - Using \b\w+en\b matches whole words ending with ''en''. Here, \w+ ensures
            the word has at least one character before ''en'', preventing matches
            of the standalone word ''en'' if undesired.

            - The pattern \b\w+en\b works well to detect such words anywhere in the
            line without anchors like ^ or $, which are unnecessary to identify the
            presence of the pattern.

            - \b represents a word boundary, so the ''en'' is ensured to be at the
            end of a word. This also handles cases where punctuation follows the word
            (e.g., ''broken,''), as word boundaries separate word characters from
            non-word characters.

            - This regex uses ASCII word characters (letters, digits, underscore).
            If unicode word characters need to be matched, consider adapting the pattern
            to the regex engine''s syntax (e.g., using \p{L}+en for letters).


            Examples:

            - Matches: "The garden", "broken", "children"

            - Does not match: "en", "entry", "openings"


            This pattern is concise, efficient, and sufficient for matching lines

            matching to letters only (no digits or underscores), meeting the requirement
            to match words ending with ''en'' made of letters. Step 3: Use word boundaries
            ''\b'' to ensure correct word detection, so only whole words ending with
            ''en'' are matched (e.g., ''pen'' matches, but ''peninsula'' does not).
            Step 4: Remove unnecessary ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' since the regex engine
            searches for pattern occurrences anywhere in a line by default, making
            the regex more efficient and clear. Step 5: Use ''a-z'' and the case-insensitive

            Step 2: Enforce word boundaries with ''\b'' to ensure matching whole words
            only, preventing partial matches inside larger words.


            Step 3: Exclude the standalone word ''ne'' - since ''[a-z]+'' requires
            at least one letter before ''ne'', the pattern excludes the word ''ne''
            itself, which meets the problem requirements.


            Step 4: Handle case insensitivity - add the ''(?i)'' inline flag to allow
            matching ''ne'' in any casing such as ''Ne'', ''NE'', or ''nE''.


            Step 5: Simplify the regex - avoid using ''^'', ''$'', and ''.*'' anchors
            because searching for the pattern inside the line suffices to find lines
            containing such words.


            Step 6: Regarding apostrophes and hyphens, this pattern does not include
            them, so words like "caffeine-like" or "done''s" won''t be matched as
            a whole word. If including those is required, the pattern should be adjusted

            Step 4: Use [a-zA-Z]+ne\b to match words with one or more letters preceding

            - The goal is to find lines containing at least one word ending with ''ne'',
            with the word longer than just ''ne''.

            - Words should consist only of alphabetic characters (no digits or underscores).

            - We need to support case-insensitive matching to capture variants like
            ''Ne'', ''nE'', ''NE''.

            - Avoid unnecessary matching of the entire line (no ^.* and .*$), just
            find if such a word exists.


            Step 2: Word character class

            - Replace \w+ with [a-z]+ to limit to alphabetic characters only.

            - This excludes digits and underscores as per the feedback.


            Step 3: Case insensitivity

            - Use inline case-insensitive flag (?i) at the start of the regex.

            - This allows matching ''ne'' in any case (e.g., ''Ne'', ''NE'').


            Step 4: Word boundary

            - Keep \b at start and end to ensure the pattern matches whole words.

            - Be aware that \b considers transitions between word and non-word chars.


            Step 5: Unicode and accented letters

            - ASCII [a-z] won''t match Unicode letters with accents.

            - Since standard regex may not support \p{L} (Unicode letters) everywhere,
            and feedback didn''t explicitly require Unicode support, we use [a-z]
            for simplicity.

            - If Unicode support is needed, the pattern would need adjustment depending
            on the regex engine (e.g., \p{L}+ne with Unicode flag).


            Step 6: Hyphenated or contracted words

            - The current pattern treats hyphens or apostrophes as non-word boundaries,
            so words like "line-based" will have ''line'' matched separately.

            - The pattern won''t match "line-based" as one word ending with ''ne'',
            but ''line'' within it would match if delimited by spaces or punctuation.

            - Clarification about hyphenated word handling wasn''t explicit, so this
            pattern accepts words separated by non-letters.


            Step 7: Final regex

            - "(?i)\b[a-z]+ne\b"


            It matches words with only letters (a-z), at least one letter before ''ne'',
            and case-insensitively.

            Step 2: To exclude digits and underscores, we restrict the preceding characters
            to lowercase and uppercase letters using [a-z]. To handle case insensitivity
            (e.g., ''Alpine'', ''NE'', ''cone''), we add the ''(?i)'' flag so that
            the regex matches letters of any case without complexity.


            Step 3: Using ''\b'' for word boundaries ensures that we only match whole
            words.


            Step 4: The pattern ''[a-z]+ne'' ensures there is at least one alphabetical

            solution considers only letters to define words, which aligns with typical
            word definitions.


            Step 7: Testing the regex:

            - ''pine'' matches (has letters before ''ne'')

            - ''ne'' does not match (no letters before ''ne'')

            - ''7ne'' does not match (digits before ''ne'' are not letters)

            - ''_ne'' does not match (underscore is not a letter)

            - ''Alpine'' matches (case-insensitive)

            - ''NE'' does not match as a word longer than ''ne'' but would also not
            match here because of length

            - ''cone.'' matches (''cone'' before punctuation)

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Address case sensitivity. The original regex only matched
            lines starting exactly with ''The'' or ''For''. To make it case-insensitive
            so that lines starting with ''the'', ''THE'', ''For'', ''for'', etc. are
            matched, we add the inline case-insensitive flag ''(?i)''.


            Step 2: Consider leading whitespace. The original regex anchors at the
            start with ''^'' but does not allow for leading spaces or tabs. To allow
            lines that start with optional whitespace before ''The'' or ''For'', we
            prepend ''^\s*'' to match any number of whitespace characters at the start.


            Step 3: Ensure whole word matching to avoid partial matches like ''Theatre''
            or ''Formal''. Adding a word boundary ''\b'' right after ''(The|For)''
            ensures that only whole words ''The'' or ''For'' are matched at the start.


            Step 4: Handling the rest of the line. ''.*'' matches the rest of the
            line after the matched word, and ''$'' anchors the match at the end of
            the line, ensuring the entire line is matched.


            Step 5: Final regex explanation:

            - ''^\s*'' : start of line, optional whitespace

            - ''(?i)'' : case-insensitive matching

            - ''(The|For)'' : matches ''The'' or ''For''

            - ''\b'' : word boundary

            - ''.*'' : zero or more characters (rest of line)

            - ''$'' : end of line


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''The quick brown fox'', '' for example'', ''\tTHE end'', ''  For
            real''

            - Does not match: ''Theatre starts now'', ''Formal introduction''


            This refined regex is robust for typical multiline inputs where each line
            begins with optional whitespace and the word ''The'' or ''For'' in any
            casing, ensuring whole word matches only.'

      - output:
          reasoning: 'To refine the regex for matching lines that begin exactly with
            the words ''The'' or ''For'', we need to address the issues raised and
            assumptions explicitly. Step 1: Use ''^'' to anchor the match to the start
            of the line. This requires that the regex engine is in multiline mode
            if matching against multiple lines; this typically means the ''m'' flag
            should be enabled depending on the environment. Step 2: Use a non-capturing
            group ''(?:The|For)'' because capturing the matched word is not necessary,
            improving efficiency. Step 3: Add a word boundary ''\b'' immediately after
            ''The'' or ''For'' to ensure we match these words exactly and do not match
            words like ''There'' or ''Forget''. Step 4: Append ''.*'' to match the
            rest of the line after the word. Step 5: Regarding case sensitivity, since
            the problem does not specify, the regex is written to match only capitalized
            ''The'' or ''For''. If case-insensitive matching is required, a flag like
            ''i'' should be used. Example matches (assuming multiline ''m'' flag):
            - Matches: ''The cat is here'', ''For example, this works'' - Does not
            match: ''There is no match'', ''Forget it'', ''the dog'' (if case sensitive)

            using ^\s* which matches any number of spaces or tabs at the start of
            the line. Next, we match either ''The'' or ''For'' with (The|For). Since
            the problem does not specify whether matching should be case-sensitive,
            the regex itself will be case-sensitive by default, but to support case-insensitive
            matching, one can add a case-insensitive flag, usually /i, depending on
            the language. Leaving that to implementation details, the regex now matches
            lines starting with optional whitespace followed by ''The'' or ''For'',

            Step 2: Match the lowercase word ''the'' exactly. The regex is case-sensitive,
            so it only matches ''the'' and not ''The'' or ''THE''. To match case-insensitively,

            and improvements:


            1. Leading Whitespace: The original regex did not account for lines starting
            with spaces or tabs before ''the''. Using ''^\s*'' allows the line start
            anchor (^) followed by zero or more whitespace characters (spaces/tabs),
            so lines like "   the quick brown fox" will match.


            2. Word Boundary: The ''\b'' after ''the'' ensures that ''the'' is matched
            as a whole word and not as part of another word like ''there'' or ''other''.
            This prevents false positives.


            3. Case Sensitivity: The regex is explicitly case-sensitive by default,
            thus it matches only lowercase ''the'' as required. Lines starting with
            ''The'' or ''THE'' will not match.


            4. Rest of Line: ''.*$'' matches any remaining characters (including none)
            until the end of the line, allowing the line to be just ''the'' or ''the''
            followed by other text.


            5. Multiline Input: This regex should be applied line by line or with
            the multiline flag enabled (''m'') in most regex engines to ensure ''^''
            and ''$'' represent the start and end of each line respectively.


            Examples:

            - "the quick brown fox" -> matches

            - "The dog" -> does not match (uppercase ''T'')

            - "the1 is a number" -> does not match due to word boundary preventing
            ''the'' followed immediately by ''1''

            by default, improving readability and efficiency.


            Step 5: Case sensitivity is important; by default, regex is case-sensitive.
            To match words regardless of case (e.g., ''Bats'' or ''cats''), a case-insensitive
            flag should be used in the regex environment (such as ''/i'' in many languages).


            Final regex: ''\b[a-zA-Z]{3}s\b'' with case-insensitive matching to find
            any 4-letter alphabetic word ending with ''s'' anywhere in a line.'

            word ending with ''s'', where the word consists strictly of alphabetic
            letters only.


            Step 1: Match exactly 4-letter words ending with ''s''.

            - That means the word has three alphabetic letters followed by an ''s''.

            - Use [a-zA-Z] to match alphabetic characters only (no digits or underscores).


            Step 2: Use word boundaries \b at both ends to ensure we match whole words
            only, so it doesn''t match substrings within longer words.


            Step 3: Remove unnecessary anchors and wildcards.

            - Since the regex engine usually searches for the pattern anywhere in
            the line, we don''t need to anchor with ''^'' and ''$'' or use ''.*''
            around the pattern.


            Step 4: Consider case sensitivity.

            - Using [a-zA-Z] covers both uppercase and lowercase letters.

            - If the regex engine supports case-insensitive flags, we could simplify,
            but this explicit set is sufficient.


            Step 5: Testing considerations.

            - It matches ''dogs'' in ''The dogs run fast.''

            - It does not match ''dog1s'' or ''dog_s''.

            - It handles uppercase words like ''Cats''.

            - It respects punctuation boundaries, so ''cats,'' or ''(cats)'' are matched
            correctly because of word boundaries.


            Final regex: \b[a-zA-Z]{3}s\b


            This regex ensures only 4-letter alphabetic words ending with ''s'' are
            matched anywhere in the line.'

            digits or underscores.

            Step 3: The 4-letter word ending with ''s'' must be exactly 3 letters
            followed by ''s'' or ''S'', so the pattern for the word is \b[a-zA-Z]{3}[sS]\b.

            Step 4: Use a positive lookahead (?=.*pattern) to check for the existence
            of such a word anywhere in the line; this avoids greediness and improves
            efficiency.

            In regex, the pattern ''\d'' matches any ASCII digit (0-9). Since ''\d''

            to identify lines with digits, making explicit start ''^'' and end ''$''
            anchors unnecessary if the regex engine tests each line individually.


            This pattern will match lines with only digits, mixed content lines with
            digits, and lines with digits among other characters. Empty lines or lines
            without digits will not match.


            Note: ''\d'' matches ASCII digits by default. If Unicode digit matching
            is required, additional flags or patterns are needed depending on the
            regex engine.


            Regarding escaping, in many programming languages (e.g., Python, Java),
            ''\\d'' in code represents the regex ''\d''. Here, the pattern ''\d''

            start (^) to end ($).


            In many tools that process text line-by-line, simply using ''\d'' is enough
            to identify lines with digits without anchors. However, including ''^''

            Note that ''\d'' is escaped as ''\\d'' in most programming languages when
            provided as a string literal, but the actual regex matches a digit.


            Regarding line endings, this pattern matches any line regardless of whether
            lines end with ''\n'' or ''\r\n''. If multiline mode is enabled, ''^''
            and ''$'' match start and end of each line appropriately.

            enough to check if a digit exists anywhere in the line.


            Step 2: Using ''\d'' alone matches any digit character anywhere in the
            input. If the regex engine processes input line by line (e.g., reading
            lines separately), then ''\d'' suffices.


            Step 3: Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are relevant when matching entire lines
            or using multiline mode. If the regex engine supports multiline mode (''m''
            flag), ''^'' and ''$'' anchor to line starts and ends. However, since
            the requirement is only to find lines containing digits, these anchors
            are not needed unless the full line must be matched.


            Step 4: In the context of finding lines with digits:

            - Using ''\d'' with line-by-line input (e.g., splitting input into lines)
            is adequate.

            - If the entire text is processed at once with multiline mode, simply
            searching for ''\d'' will detect presence of digit in any line.


            Step 5: Edge cases:

            - Empty lines: ''\d'' will not match, as they contain no characters.

            - Lines with only special characters but no digits: no match.

            \ character \u2014 effectively any character, including newline characters.\n\
            3. Structure of pattern:\n   - '^[\\s\\S]*' matches zero or more of any\

            Step 2: Define what constitutes a word. We assume a word to be sequences
            of alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z). We exclude digits and underscores
            to avoid matching numeric or underscore-based strings like ''123ing''
            or ''abc_ing''.


            Step 3: The pattern ''\b[a-zA-Z]+ing\b'' ensures:

            - ''\b'' asserts a word boundary before and after the word.

            - ''[a-zA-Z]+'' requires one or more alphabets before ''ing'', ensuring
            words like ''ing'' alone are excluded.

            - ''ing'' at the end matches the suffix.


            Step 4: Remove ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' as most regex engines search within
            a line by default, so these are redundant.


            Step 5: Add case-insensitivity when applying this regex (e.g., re.IGNORECASE

            break words)


            Step 7: For Unicode support, the regex engine should support Unicode-aware
            word boundaries and alphabetic matching. If needed, the pattern can be
            adapted, but for standard ASCII, this pattern suffices.

            - We focus on words comprised only of letters [a-zA-Z], excluding digits
            and underscores.

            - We want lines that contain at least one whole word where ''e'' appears
            somewhere after ''c'' in the word.

            - The search is case-insensitive to include uppercase and lowercase letters.

            - Words are separated by non-letter characters (using word boundaries
            \b which work for letters).


            Step 2: Construct the pattern for a single word with ''c'' preceding ''e'':

            - Use [a-zA-Z]* to match any letters before ''c'', then ''c'', then any
            letters before ''e'', then ''e'', then remaining letters.

            - This ensures positional order: ''c'' appears before ''e'', and both
            letters are inside the same word.


            Step 3: Wrap this pattern with word boundaries \b to identify whole words.


            Step 4: Use a positive lookahead (?=.*\b[a-zA-Z]*c[a-zA-Z]*e[a-zA-Z]*\b)
            to assert that somewhere in the line exists such a word.


            Step 5: Use ^ and $ to match the entire line.


            Step 6: Use case-insensitive flag to match ''C'' and ''E'' as well. This
            flag is to be set in the regex engine (e.g., /.../i), since JSON does
            not include flags, note that the flag must be used in matching.


            Step 7: Examples:

            - Matches line: "The cafe is open." ("cafe" has ''c'' before ''e'').

            - Does not match line: "The ace is nice." ("ace" has ''e'' after ''c'',
            matches good).

            - Does not match line: "He is cool." (no ''e'' after ''c'' in any word).

            Step 2: Redefine ''word'' as only alphabetic characters [a-zA-Z]+ to exclude
            digits and underscores, since original ''\w'' includes them and is not
            desired.


            Step 3: Ensure case-insensitivity by using the ''i'' flag when applying
            the regex, so it matches ''C'' and ''E'' as well.


            Step 4: Construct the pattern for a word containing ''c'' followed later
            by ''e'':

            - Start with a word boundary ''\b''

            - Then zero or more alphabetic letters: [a-zA-Z]*

            - Then ''c'' or ''C'': matched due to case-insensitive flag

            - Then ''e'' or ''E'': matched due to case-insensitive flag

            - Then zero or more alphabetic letters: [a-zA-Z]*

            - Ending with word boundary ''\b''


            This ensures the ''c'' appears before ''e'' within the same word.


            Step 5: Use a positive lookahead from start of line to assert presence
            of such a word: ''(?=.*\b[a-zA-Z]*c[a-zA-Z]*e[a-zA-Z]*\b)''. This ensures

            Step 2: Ensure case insensitivity by matching both uppercase and lowercase
            letters explicitly for ''c'' and ''e'' using [cC] and [eE].


            Step 3: To guarantee that ''e'' appears after ''c'' in a word, the pattern
            [a-zA-Z]*[cC][a-zA-Z]*[eE][a-zA-Z]* matches a word boundary, then zero
            or more letters, then ''c'' (or ''C''), then zero or more letters, then
            ''e'' (or ''E''), then zero or more letters, ending at a word boundary.


            This ensures that the first ''c'' comes before the first ''e'' because
            the sequence expects letters (excluding ''e'') or any letter between them
            and finds ''c'' first, then ''e''.


            Step 4: Use a positive lookahead (?=.*\b[a-zA-Z]*[cC][a-zA-Z]*[eE][a-zA-Z]*\b)

            this regex assumes the engine is case sensitive by default; if not, case
            sensitivity flags should be explicitly set (e.g., no 'i' flag). Since

            is sufficient and more efficient.


            Step 4: The regex assumes usage in a context where the input is handled
            line-by-line or the regex engine supports multiline mode to allow individual
            lines to be matched.


            Step 5: The match is case-sensitive by default, so no additional flags
            for case insensitivity are needed.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''I trust you.'', ''This trust is important.''

            - Does not match: ''trusted'', ''distrust'', ''Trust'' (capitalized)


            Note: Implementation should consider processing each line individually
            or use multiline mode with appropriate flags depending on the regex engine
            to apply this regex per line.'

            input or specific matching behavior is relevant, it would depend on the

            If the regex engine supports Unicode word boundaries (like ''\b{wb}''),
            using that is preferable for accurate matching in Unicode contexts.

            Step 6: Punctuation adjacent to ''Hindi'' (e.g., ''Hindi,'' or ''Hindi.'')
            is handled correctly by ''\b'', since punctuation is a non-word character,
            so the boundary is detected correctly.


            Therefore, the refined regex is ''\bHindi\b'' used with a case-insensitive
            flag, and where possible, use Unicode-aware word boundaries depending
            on the regex engine.'

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Clarify requirements: we want to match lines containing
            ''Hindi'' as a whole word, not just as a substring; also, match should
            be case-insensitive to catch variations like ''hindi'' or ''HINDI''.

            Step 2: To match whole words, use word boundaries ''\b'' around ''Hindi''
            as ''\bHindi\b''.

            Step 3: For case-insensitive matching, the regex engine should use the
            case-insensitive flag (often ''i''), which is usually applied outside
            the pattern. Since the problem requests the regex pattern itself, we provide
            the pattern with word boundaries; the flag is typically specified separately.

            Step 4: Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are unnecessary since matching lines containing
            the pattern is typically handled by line-based matching context in tools.

            Step 5: Final pattern: ''\bHindi\b'' with case-insensitive matching enabled

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Objective is to match lines containing the word ''Hindi''
            as a distinct word, regardless of its position in the line.


            Step 2: The regex ''\bHindi\b'' uses word boundaries (''\b'') to ensure
            ''Hindi'' is matched as an entire word, preventing partial matches such
            as ''Hindian'' or ''Hindi123''.


            Step 3: Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' and surrounding ''.*'' are not necessary
            when searching within lines, as the search function or tool typically
            scans each line independently.


            Step 4: Case sensitivity depends on the context. If matching case-insensitively
            is desired (e.g., also matching ''hindi'', ''HINDI''), the appropriate
            flag (like ''i'' for case-insensitive in many regex engines) should be
            used alongside this regex.


            Step 5: This regex will also correctly match ''Hindi'' when surrounded
            by punctuation due to ''\b'' definition, which recognizes word boundaries
            at non-word characters.


            Example test cases:

            - Matches: "I speak Hindi.", "hindi is spoken in India", "Learning HINDI
            is fun!"

            - Does not match: "Hindian culture", "My hobby is hindered"


            Note: In Python, usage could be re.search(r''\bHindi\b'', line, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
            for case-insensitive matching.

            In grep, use: grep -iw ''Hindi'' filename


            This approach balances simplicity, correctness, and adaptability across
            environments.'
          regex: \bHindi\b

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Clarify the context - this regex is intended for use
            with search functions (like Python''s re.search or similar search methods)
            that check if a line contains a particular pattern, so anchors ''^'' and
            ''$'' and surrounding ''.*'' are unnecessary.


            Step 2: To match the word ''Hindi'' as a whole word and not part of a
            longer word, use word boundaries ''\b''. This ensures ''Hindi'' matches
            but ''Hindian'' or ''MahiHindi'' do not.


            Step 3: Make the match case-insensitive by using the inline flag ''(?i)''.
            This ensures it matches ''Hindi'', ''hindi'', ''HINDI'', etc.


            Step 4: Regarding Unicode word boundaries, ''\b'' generally works in most
            modern regex engines with Unicode support enabled. Assuming the regex
            engine supports Unicode-aware ''\b'', this is sufficient to handle word
            boundaries in lines that may contain non-ASCII characters.


            Step 5: Examples:

            - Matches: ''I speak Hindi.'', ''hindi is my language.'', ''The word HINDI
            appears here.''

            - Non-matches: ''Hindian cuisine'', ''Mandhi is a place.''


            In summary, the regex ''(?i)\bHindi\b'' correctly identifies lines containing

            Step 3: Anchors like ''^'' and ''$'' and greedy patterns ''.*'' are unnecessary
            and can hurt performance because most line-filtering tools (e.g., grep)
            search for a substring match within lines.

            Step 4: To handle different cases such as ''and'', ''And'', ''AND'', etc.,
            we add the case-insensitive flag ''(?i)''. This avoids missing matches
            with uppercase or mixed-case ''and''.

            Step 5: Examples of matched content include ''and'', ''and,'', ''(and)'',

            Step 6: Assumption: The regex is used in a context where lines are tested
            for containing this pattern, so the regex does not need to match the entire
            line but just identify the presence of the word.


            Final regex is ''(?i)\band\b'', which effectively matches any case variation

            on the programming environment or tool. Additionally, since input might

            word only. The ''\b'' denotes word boundaries that match positions where
            a word character (letters, digits, underscore) meets a non-word character
            (like space, punctuation) or start/end of line.

            - This prevents matching partial words like ''inoperatively'' or ''theinoperative''.

            - To match ''inoperative'' in any casing (e.g., ''Inoperative'', ''INOPERATIVE''),
            use a case-insensitive flag.

            - This can be done with ''(?i)'' inline modifier at the start of the regex.

            - Avoid using ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' as they are redundant for searching
            the word anywhere in the line and can cause performance issues due to
            unnecessary backtracking.

            - This regex assumes a regex engine that supports ''\b'' word boundaries
            and the inline case-insensitive modifier ''(?i)'', such as Python''s ''re''
            module, or other modern regex engines.

            'INOPERATIVE', etc.), a case-insensitive flag (like 'i') should be enabled
            in the regex engine, though this is typically set outside the pattern.
            Note that '\b' is generally sufficient for matching word boundaries with
            ASCII and common Unicode characters, but behavior may vary by environment.
            For full Unicode word boundary support, engine-specific flags or Unicode-aware

            Step 3: The regex as provided is case-sensitive and will only match ''orange''
            in lowercase. To perform case-insensitive matching, one can use:

            - In regex flavors that support inline flags: ''(?i)\borange\b''

            - In command-line grep: ''grep -i "\borange\b"''

            - In Python re module: use the flag re.IGNORECASE with the pattern ''\borange\b''


            Step 4: Example usages:

            - grep (command line): grep -w -i ''orange'' file.txt

            - Python: re.search(r''\borange\b'', line, re.IGNORECASE)


            This approach balances readability, correctness for whole word matching,
            and practical applicability in many programming and scripting contexts.'

          reasoning: '1. The goal is to match complete lines that contain the word
            ''orange'' regardless of case.

            2. Instead of using a complex positive lookahead, we use a simpler pattern
            that matches the entire line only if it contains ''orange'' as a whole
            word.

            3. The pattern `\borange\b` ensures ''orange'' is matched as a distinct
            word, handling punctuation such as commas or periods adjacent to the word.

            4. The `^` and `$` anchors ensure the regex matches the entire line.

            5. `.*` before and after allows for any characters in the line before
            and after the word.

            6. The `(?i)` at the start makes the regex case-insensitive, allowing
            matches for ''Orange'', ''ORANGE'', etc.

            7. This regex assumes the input is processed line-by-line or with multiline
            mode enabled, ensuring the anchors match line start/end.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''I ate an orange today.''

            - Matches: ''ORANGE is my favorite color''

            - Matches: ''She said, "orange!"''

            - Does not match: ''I like oranges.'' (because "oranges" is not "orange"
            exactly)


            This approach is straightforward, efficient, and clear for the requirement.'
          regex: (?i)^.*\borange\b.*$
        score: 1.0
      - output:
          reasoning: 'Step 1: The original regex used ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' anchors
            along with greedy ''.*'', which can cause inefficient backtracking and
            is unnecessary since most regex search functions look for matches anywhere
            in the string by default.


            Step 2: Removing ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' simplifies the regex while retaining
            the requirement to find the word ''orange'' anywhere in the line.


            Step 3: Using ''\b'' word boundaries ensures the match is for the whole
            word ''orange'', avoiding matches within substrings (like ''oranges''
            or ''orangery'').


            Step 4: To handle case insensitivity (matching ''Orange'', ''ORANGE'',
            etc.), the regex engine should be used with the case-insensitive flag
            (commonly ''i''). This means the regex pattern remains ''\borange\b''
            but should be applied with case-insensitive matching enabled.


            Step 5: Note that ''\b'' word boundaries are defined by transitions between
            word characters (letters, digits, underscore) and non-word characters,
            so punctuation immediately following ''orange'' (like ''orange!'') will
            still match.


            Step 6: For Unicode word boundaries, depending on the regex engine, ensure
            Unicode mode is enabled if the input may contain non-ASCII characters.


            Step 7: Always test the regex on various sample lines such as ''orange'',
            ''Orange juice'', ''orange!'', "orange''s", and ''oranges'' to confirm
            correct matching behavior.


            This approach optimizes performance, is simpler, and clarifies usage regarding
            case sensitivity and word boundary implications.'
          regex: \borange\b

      - output:
          reasoning: '1. **Clarify context**: This regex is intended for use in a
            context where each line is processed individually, such as in many command-line
            tools (grep) or programming languages'' line-by-line search methods.


            2. **Removing unnecessary anchors and greedy patterns**: The previous
            regex used ''^.*'' and ''.*$'', which is redundant since we are searching
            within a line. Simply searching for ''\borange\b'' is enough to locate
            the word ''orange'' anywhere in the line.


            3. **Word boundaries**: Using ''\b'' ensures that ''orange'' is matched
            as a whole word, avoiding partial matches like ''oranges'' or ''doorange''.


            4. **Case sensitivity**: Since the problem does not specify case sensitivity,
            to commonly handle any case variation (''Orange'', ''ORANGE''), use a
            case-insensitive search flag (e.g., ''i'' in most regex engines). This
            is preferred over complex case-insensitive patterns.


            5. **Punctuation handling**: Word boundaries ''\b'' often work well with
            punctuation by separating word characters from non-word characters. So
            punctuation immediately adjacent to ''orange'' will not affect matching.


            6. **Performance considerations**: Avoiding ''.*'' prevents unnecessary
            backtracking and improves performance especially on long lines.


            **Summary**: Use the regex ''\borange\b'' with a case-insensitive flag
            when searching lines individually; this efficiently matches lines containing
            the whole word ''orange'' in any case and handles punctuation correctly.'

          reasoning: 'Step 1: The user wants to match lines containing the word ''orange''.

            Step 2: The original regex ''^.*\borange\b.*$'' correctly matches entire
            lines with ''orange'' but uses unnecessary ''.*'' and anchors, which are
            redundant in many regex tools that search substrings within lines by default.

            Step 3: Simplify the regex to ''\borange\b'' to match the word ''orange''
            exactly, with word boundaries ensuring it is not matched as part of another
            word.

            Step 4: To handle case insensitivity (matching ''Orange'', ''ORANGE'',
            etc.), the regex search should be performed with the case-insensitive
            flag (e.g., /i) since mixing in inline flags or alternate casing would
            complicate the regex unnecessarily.

            Step 5: For multiline input, ensure the regex is applied in a way that
            searches line by line (many tools do this by default) or with flags that
            allow ''^'' and ''$'' to match start/end of lines if full line matching
            is required.

            Step 6: The behavior of ''\b'' depends on the regex engine and Unicode
            handling; if the environment supports Unicode-aware word boundaries, \b
            is appropriate. Otherwise, adjustments might be needed.


            Therefore, a simple regex ''\borange\b'' combined with case-insensitive
            matching and appropriate line-by-line processing is best practice and
            flexible across environments.'

            with ''pa'', where ''pa'' can be in any case (e.g., ''Pa'', ''PA''). Therefore,
            case-insensitive matching is required. I use the inline case-insensitive
            flag ''(?i)'' which works in many regex engines like Python''s ''re''
            module with inline flags, or others that support inline modifiers.


            Step 2: To avoid overcomplicating the regex and considering that many
            regex engines operate line-by-line by default or can be applied that way,
            I removed the anchors ''^'' and ''$'' which enforce matching the entire
            line. This simplifies the pattern and improves performance.


            Step 3: The core matching unit is a word starting with ''pa''. Instead
            of ''\bpa\w*\b'' which only matches word characters and could miss apostrophes
            or other characters common in words (like "pa''s"), I expanded the character
            class after ''pa'' to include apostrophes, i.e. ''[\w'']*''. This allows
            matching words like "pa''s".


            Step 4: ''\b'' word boundaries are used on both sides to ensure we match
            whole words, avoiding partial matches inside other words.


            Step 5: This regex assumes usage in regex engines that support ''\b'',
            inline flags ''(?i)'', and standard character classes like ''\w''. For
            specific engines (e.g., JavaScript), flags like ''/i'' would be added
            externally, or ''(?i)'' omitted if flags are passed separately.


            Step 6: Example test cases the pattern matches:

            - ''Pa'' (case-insensitive match)

            - ''painter'' (starts with ''pa'')

            - "pa''s" (includes apostrophe)

            - ''Palindrome''

            - ''Paper''


            Step 7: Regarding Unicode, ''\w'' matches Unicode word characters in many
            modern regex engines (like Python 3 or .NET). Apostrophes are specifically
            included. However, certain Unicode scripts might contain characters not
            matched by ''\w'', which may require a more advanced Unicode property
            matching approach. This solution assumes most common use cases.


            Hence, the final regex is ''(?i)\bpa[\w'']*\b'' which matches any word
            starting with ''pa'' in a case-insensitive manner, allowing for apostrophes
            inside the word, suitable for line-by-line matching without unnecessary
            anchors.'
          regex: (?i)\bpa[\w']*\b

            use of ''.*'', which can hurt performance when searching substrings within
            lines. The simplified regex ''\bpa\w*\b'' matches any word boundary followed
            by ''pa'' and zero or more word characters until the next word boundary.
            This is generally sufficient to find such words in a line using search
            operations.


            Furthermore, to handle case-insensitive matches (such as ''Pa'', ''PA'',
            or ''pA''), it''s best to apply a case-insensitive matching flag (like
            /i in many regex engines) rather than complicate the pattern itself. For
            example, in many languages or tools, you would use this pattern with the
            case-insensitive flag enabled.


            Note on word boundaries: ''\b'' matches transition between word characters
            ([A-Za-z0-9_]) and non-word characters. This means underscores are considered
            part of words, which might cause unexpected matches if targeting strict
            alphabetic words.


            Example matches:

            - ''partial'' (matches because ''partial'' starts with ''pa'')

            - ''Papa'' (matches with case-insensitive flag)

            - ''The painting is nice.'' (matches for ''painting'')


            Example non-match:

            - ''apple'' (does not start with ''pa'')


            In summary, the regex ''\bpa\w*\b'' with case-insensitive matching is

            words starting with ''pa'' are matched (e.g., ''companion'' won''t match
            because ''pa'' is not at a word start).

            Step 3: To handle case-insensitivity, we match both uppercase and lowercase
            letters explicitly in the pattern using character classes: ''[Pp]'' matches
            ''P'' or ''p'', ''[Aa]'' matches ''A'' or ''a''.

            Step 4: After ''pa'' or ''PA'', the word can continue with zero or more

            Step 3: Using ''\b'' ensures we match word boundaries, so the pattern
            ''\b[x]\w*\b'' matches any whole word starting with ''x'' or ''X''. The
            ''\w'' character class, in Unicode-aware regex engines, matches Unicode

            Step 6: While ''[\w]'' is ASCII by default, for Unicode-aware engines,

            about digits and underscores.


            Step 7: The final pattern ''\b[xX][\w]*\b'' matches any word starting
            with ''x'' or ''X'' followed by zero or more word characters, capturing
            valid words that may contain digits or underscores.


            Step 8: This pattern matches words at any position in the line, handles
            words adjacent to punctuation because of the word boundaries, and does

            ''x'' and ''X'').


            Step 2: The regex flavor assumed here supports standard POSIX/PCRE syntax
            with case-insensitive mode (?i).


            Step 3: Using the inline case-insensitive flag (?i) simplifies the pattern
            by allowing just ''x'' instead of [xX].


            Step 4: Words can contain apostrophes and hyphens (common in natural language),
            so instead of \w*, the pattern after ''x'' is [\w''-]* to include these
            characters.


            Step 5: Word boundaries (\b) are used to define word limits; this matches
            word starts and ends even next to punctuation (e.g. "x-ray", "x''s"),
            as \b matches transitions between word characters and non-word characters.


            Step 6: The entire line should be matched (from ^ to $) since the requirement
            is to match a full line. We include .* before and after the target word
            pattern to allow any content on the line.


            Step 7: Although .* is greedy and can be inefficient on very long inputs,
            since we are matching full lines, this standard approach is acceptable;
            if performance is critical, line-by-line searching using substring match
            of \b[x][\w''-]*\b with case insensitive flag is preferred.


            Step 8: Therefore, the full pattern is (?i)^.*\b[x][\w''-]*\b.*$, matching

            2. Used the case-insensitive flag (outside the regex itself, e.g., re.IGNORECASE

            ''^'' or ''$''.


            Using ''.*?'' (non-greedy) instead of ''.*'' helps improve performance
            by minimizing backtracking when matching characters between ''ABC'' and
            ''JFK''.


            The ''(?i)'' flag at the start makes the match case-insensitive, so lines
            with varying cases like ''abc'' and ''jfk'' are also matched.


            Note that ''.*?'' matches any character except newline zero or more times,
            and since the problem scope assumes matching within a line, it does not
            handle substrings split across multiple lines.


            Testing with various cases:

            - Line without ''ABC'' or ''JFK'': no match.

            - Line with ''JFK'' before ''ABC'': no match, since ''ABC'' must precede
            ''JFK''.

            - Line with multiple ''ABC''s and ''JFK''s: the regex will match if any

            Step 2: Regarding case sensitivity, since the problem does not specify,
            the regex is written to be case-sensitive. If case-insensitivity is desired,
            the ''i'' flag can be added depending on the regex engine.


            Step 3: About anchors (''^'' and ''$''), these are often unnecessary when
            matching entire lines in line-by-line processing, so they are omitted
            for simplicity.


            Step 4: To handle potential newline characters between ''ABC'' and ''JFK'',
            ''.*'' is replaced with ''[\s\S]*'' which matches any character including
            newlines.


            Step 5: The regex ''ABC[\s\S]*JFK'' matches ''ABC'' followed by any characters
            (including newlines) then ''JFK''.


            Step 6: Performance-wise, the greedy ''[\s\S]*'' is necessary here to
            ensure all characters (including newlines) are matched, though if used
            in large inputs, it could be optimized with context-specific constraints.


            Examples:

            - Does not match: ''JFK before ABC'', ''nothing relevant''

            Step 5: This simple regex works well in most line-by-line matching tools

            In most regex engines, searching for ''44'' alone is sufficient since
            they find substrings by default within a string or line.


            Using ''^.*44.*$'' is redundant because:

            - The anchors ''^'' and ''$'' match the start and end of the line, but
            regex searches typically scan for matches anywhere in the line without
            needing explicit anchors.

            - The ''.*'' before and after ''44'' just matches any characters, which
            is unnecessary when searching for the substring.


            Thus, ''44'' alone will match any line containing ''44'', including cases
            where ''44'' is part of a larger number or string, e.g., ''1444'', ''044'',
            or ''abc44xyz''.

            Step 2: Using just ''44'' without anchors or surrounding wildcards allows
            regex search functions (which typically search within the string) to detect
            the presence of ''44'' regardless of its position.


            Step 3: Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are unnecessary here and may restrict
            matching to the entire line, which is not required.


            Additional Notes:

            - Matching is straightforward because digits have no case sensitivity.

            - The regex will find any occurrence, including multiple or overlapping
            ''44''s.

            - If exact full-line matching is needed, anchors could be added, but for

            Step 7: Regarding punctuation, ''\b'' handles standard word boundaries;
            however, if the text has punctuation directly attached to words (e.g.,
            ''love,'' or ''you.''), ''\b'' still considers punctuation as non-word
            characters, so it correctly separates words.


            Step 8: Examples to validate:

            - ''I love you.'' -> matches (love before you)

            - ''You love me.'' -> does not match (you before love)

            - ''Love, I feel for you is strong.'' -> matches

            - ''Do you love me?'' -> does not match


            Overall, the improved regex is ''^(?=.*\blove\b.*\byou\b).*$'' with the

          reasoning: We aim to match lines containing the word 'love' followed *somewhere
            later* by the word 'you', ensuring 'love' precedes 'you'. Both words should
            be matched as whole words, denoted by \b word boundaries. To allow for
            punctuation (like commas or exclamation marks) between words, the pattern
            between 'love' and 'you' uses a non-word character class [^\w]+ allowing
            punctuation and whitespace, followed by word characters \w+, repeated
            zero or more times. This way, we accommodate punctuation directly attached
            to words (e.g., 'love,' or 'you!'). The regex does not anchor with ^ or
            $ because we only need to check presence and order within the line, improving
            efficiency and flexibility. The pattern is intended for case-insensitive
            matching, so a case-insensitive flag should be used when applying this
            regex (e.g., /pattern/i). This approach ensures that the first occurrence
            of 'love' appears before the first occurrence of 'you' in the line while
            allowing various characters and punctuation between them.

            Step 2: Use ''\b'' to denote word boundaries ensuring entire words are

            The problem asks for matching lines that "use the letter ''a'' or ''b''
            before words ending with ''er''". This likely means lines containing words
            that start with ''a'' or ''b'' (case-insensitive) and end with ''er''.
            For example, words like "After", "better", "baker", or "a-lister" should
            be matched.


            Step 1: Handle Case Sensitivity

            - To capture both uppercase and lowercase letters ''a'' or ''b'', we include
            both cases in the character set as [abAB], or specify a case-insensitive
            flag if supported.


            Step 2: Match Words Ending with ''er''

            - Words must begin with ''a'' or ''b'' and end with ''er''.

            - Between the start letter and ''er'', words can include letters, digits,
            underscores (\w), apostrophes (''), or hyphens (-), since such constructions
            are common in English words (e.g., "a-lister", "baker''s").

            - Therefore, we use the character class [\w''-]* to allow these characters.


            Step 3: Use Word Boundaries

            - To ensure we match full words and avoid partial matches inside longer
            words, we use word boundary anchors \b.


            Step 4: Ensure Line Contains Such a Word

            - We use a positive lookahead (?=.*\b[abAB][\w''-]*er\b) to assert the
            presence of at least one matching word anywhere in the line.


            Step 5: Match the entire line

            - Finally, we match the entire line with ^.*$.


            Edge Cases & Testing:

            - Matches: "After dinner", "Better days", "baker''s dozen", "A-lister".

            - Non-matches: Words not starting with ''a'' or ''b'', words not ending
            with ''er'', or letters ''a'' or ''b'' occurring elsewhere (e.g., "cater",
            "player", "a river" with ''river'' not starting with ''a'' or ''b'').


            Note on Flags:

            - If the regex engine supports flags, setting the case-insensitive flag
            (/i) can simplify the pattern to [ab] instead of [abAB]. However, since
            not all environments allow flags, we include both uppercase and lowercase
            explicitly.

            or ''lie'' as whole words, regardless of case.


            1. **Word boundaries (`\b`)**: Using `\b` around ''lay'' and ''lie'' ensures
            that these words are matched only as stand-alone words, not as substrings
            of other words. For example, ''lay'' will match in "I will lay here" but
            not within ''display''. This also handles punctuation properly since word
            boundaries match positions between word characters ([a-zA-Z0-9_]) and
            non-word characters (such as space, punctuation, or start/end of line).
            So ''lay,'' or ''lie.'' will still match.


            2. **Case-insensitive flag (`(?i)`)**: Adding `(?i)` at the beginning
            makes the regex case-insensitive, allowing it to match ''Lay'', ''LIE'',
            ''lie'', etc., without needing multiple alternatives.


            3. **No anchors (`^` or `$`)**: We avoid anchoring to start or end of
            line because the regex is intended to find whether the line contains the
            words anywhere. When used with line-by-line matching or search functions,
            this ensures any line containing ''lay'' or ''lie'' will be matched.


            4. **Simplicity and efficiency**: This regex is straightforward and efficient,
            avoiding unnecessary complexity such as lookaheads or full line matching
            constructs.


            **Example usage:**

            - The line "I will lay, here." matches because `\b` treats the comma as
            a boundary.

            - The line "This is a display." does not match because ''lay'' is part
            of ''display'', not a whole word.


            In summary, `(?i)\b(lay|lie)\b` is a concise, clear, and correct regex

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. Use ''\b'' to assert a word boundary ensuring the word start is matched
            correctly.

            2. Match ''b'' or ''B'' using ''[bB]'' to make the regex case-insensitive
            without relying on flags.

            3. Use ''[a-zA-Z]*'' to match zero or more alphabetic characters following
            the initial ''b'', thus excluding digits and underscores.

            4. To include apostrophes or hyphens within words (e.g., "b''s", "b-related"),
            add a non-capturing group ''(?:[''-][a-zA-Z]+)*'' that matches zero or
            more occurrences of an apostrophe or hyphen followed by one or more alphabetic
            characters.


            This regex will match words starting with ''b'' or ''B'' that may include
            internal apostrophes or hyphens, consisting solely of alphabetic characters
            and these special characters, excluding digits and underscores.


            When used with regex search functions, this pattern will find any such
            word anywhere in the line, effectively identifying lines utilizing words
            starting with ''b'' or ''B'' per the requirements.'

            surrounding ''.*'' which are redundant when searching within lines. 2.
            Case-insensitivity: Use a case-insensitive flag ("i") wherever the regex
            is applied, so that matching ''b'' or ''B'' does not require using [bB].
            3. Word boundaries: \b on both sides ensure matching whole words that
            start with ''b''. 4. Word character definition: \w includes letters, digits,
            and underscore; if underscores or digits are acceptable as part of the
            word, this is fine. Otherwise, consider limiting to letters only (e.g.,
            [a-zA-Z]*). Assume typical English words are acceptable here. 5. Unicode
            considerations: Standard \b and \w depend on the regex engine. Some engines
            are limited to ASCII, others have Unicode-aware modes. If Unicode word
            detection is required, adjust accordingly (e.g., using Unicode property
            escapes in modern engines: \b\p{L}b\p{L}*\b with /iu). 6. Context of usage
            (e.g., grep, Python, JavaScript) affects how to specify case-insensitivity
            and Unicode support. 7. Examples handled correctly: "banana" (matches),
            "Blue" (matches), "b2" (matches if digits acceptable), "b_word" (matches

            matters. 4) Case sensitivity is not explicitly specified; if case-insensitive
            matching is needed, it can be done via regex flags outside the pattern.
            5) This regex ensures at least one occurrence of ''sec'' before at least
            one occurrence of ''mun'' in the line. It does not handle overlapping
            (they cannot overlap as they''re distinct words) or multiple occurrences
            beyond the order constraint.'

          reasoning: 'Step-by-step reasoning:


            1. Problem requirement: Match lines where the word ''sec'' appears before
            the word ''mun''.

            2. To ensure we match ''sec'' before ''mun'', ''sec'' must appear in the
            line before ''mun''.

            3. Use word boundaries ''\b'' around ''sec'' and ''mun'' to match them
            as whole words, avoiding partial matches like ''second'' or ''commune''.

            4. Use ''.*'' (any characters) between the words to allow other text in
            between.

            5. Use the case-insensitive flag ''(?i)'' to match ''Sec'', ''SEC'', ''mun'',
            ''MUN'', etc.

            6. Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are included to ensure matching the whole line,
            which is often desired for line-based matching tools.


            Example:

            - Matches: ''The sec department is near the mun hall.''

            - Does not match: ''The mun district surpasses the sec in size.'' (because
            ''mun'' appears before ''sec'')


            This regex balances clarity, correctness, and practical matching needs.'

          reasoning: "To address the issues identified, the regex is refined as follows:\n\
            \n1. **Word Boundaries:** Using `\\b` around 'sec' and 'mun' ensures that\
            \ we match them as whole words, avoiding matching them as substrings within\
            \ other words. This prevents false positives where 'sec' or 'mun' appear\
            \ inside larger words.\n\n2. **Non-greedy Matching:** Using `.*?` (non-greedy)\
            \ between 'sec' and 'mun' ensures that 'sec' occurs before the first occurrence\
            \ of 'mun' in the line.\n\n3. **Lookahead Assertions:** To confirm both\
            \ words appear and 'sec' precedes 'mun' regardless of other content, positive\
            \ lookaheads are used:\n   - `(?=.*\\bsec\\b)` asserts that 'sec' appears\
            \ somewhere in the line.\n   - `(?=.*\\bmun\\b)` asserts that 'mun' appears\
            \ somewhere in the line.\n   - `(?=.*\\bsec\\b.*?\\bmun\\b)` asserts that\
            \ 'sec' appears before 'mun'.\n\n4. **Anchors:** `^` and `$` to anchor\
            \ the match to the full line.\n\n5. **Handling multiple occurrences:**\
            \ Because of lookaheads and non-greedy matching, this regex correctly\
            \ handles multiple 'sec' and 'mun' occurrences, enforcing that at least\
            \ one 'sec' occurs before one 'mun'.\n\n6. **Case Sensitivity:** The regex\
            \ as-is is case sensitive. If case insensitivity is needed, the `i` flag\
            \ should be used in the regex engine.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Matches:\n \
            \ - \"This section includes mun details.\" (sec before mun in words 'section'\
            \ and 'mun' - but due to word boundaries, 'section' won't match 'sec',\
            \ so this will NOT match.)\n  - \"The sec alarm and the mun signal are\
            \ active.\" (matches, 'sec' and 'mun' as whole words, 'sec' before 'mun')\n\
            \  - \"sec something mun\" (matches)\n\n- Non-matches:\n  - \"mun and\
            \ then sec\" (mun before sec)\n  - \"this is a secondary munishment\"\
            \ (no exact 'sec' or 'mun' as words)\n\nThis approach ensures the regex\
            \ robustly and precisely matches lines where the whole word 'sec' appears\
            \ before the whole word 'mun'."

          reasoning: 'Given the feedback, the regex needs improvement in handling
            punctuation and whitespace between ''Triple'' and the word starting with
            ''X''.


            1. To avoid the inefficiency of ''^.*'' and ''.*$'', we remove these and
            rely on a pattern that will find matches within any line.


            2. We maintain word boundaries around ''Triple'' (\bTriple\b) to match
            it as a standalone word.


            3. Between ''Triple'' and the next word, we allow for zero or more characters
            that may be whitespace characters or common punctuation marks (commas,
            semicolons, colons, hyphens). Hence, we use [\s,;:\-]* to cover spaces,
            tabs, commas, semicolons, colons, and hyphens.


            4. We then look for a word starting with ''X'', with word boundaries:
            \bX\w*\b ensuring ''X'' starts the word and the word is bounded.


            5. This regex does not anchor to the start or end of lines as the goal
            is to find lines containing the pattern. It should be used with multiline
            mode or applied against lines individually.


            6. Note: The regex assumes both ''Triple'' and the ''X'' word are within
            the same line, as across-line matches are uncommon in typical regex scenarios
            unless multiple line modes or special flags are used.


            This regex will robustly match lines containing ''Triple'' followed immediately
            (possibly separated by whitespace and certain punctuation) by a word that
            starts with ''X'', such as ''Triple,Xylophone'' or ''Triple    X-ray''.'
          regex: \bTriple\b[\s,;:\-]*\bX\w*\b
        score: 1.0
      - output:
          reasoning: 'Step 1: We want to match the word ''Triple'' as a whole word,
            so we use ''\bTriple\b'' to ensure word boundaries.


            Step 2: The word starting with ''X'' should directly follow ''Triple''
            allowing only whitespace (spaces or tabs) in between, so we use ''\s+''
            to represent one or more whitespace characters.


            Step 3: We match a word starting with ''X'' as ''\bX\w*\b'', ensuring
            it''s a full word starting with ''X'' followed by zero or more word characters,
            bounded by word boundaries to avoid partial matches.


            Step 4: We do not use ''^.*'' or ''.*$'' anchors since matching the entire
            line isn''t necessary; the pattern can appear anywhere in the line.


            Step 5: This pattern does not allow punctuation or any other characters
            between ''Triple'' and the ''X'' word, which matches the requirement that
            it should be ''directly followed'' with only whitespace in between.


            Step 6: The regex is suitable for case-sensitive matching. If case insensitivity
            is desired, a flag can be added depending on the regex engine.


            Thus, the final regex is ''\bTriple\b\s+\bX\w*\b'', which finds occurrences
            where ''Triple'' is directly followed by a word starting with ''X'' with
            only whitespace separating them.'

          reasoning: '1. Removed anchors ^ and $ to allow matching the pattern anywhere
            in the line rather than the entire line.

            2. Used \b (word boundaries) around ''Triple'' to ensure it''s matched
            as a whole word.

            3. Replaced ''\s+'' with a single space '' '' to ensure words are directly
            adjacent separated by spaces only (no line breaks or other whitespace).

            4. Used a non-capturing group (?: +\bX\w*\b)+ to match one or more words
            starting with ''X'' following ''Triple'', each separated by a single space.

            5. This ensures ''Triple'' is immediately followed by one or more words
            starting with ''X'', with exactly one space between each word.

            6. The regex is case-sensitive; if case-insensitive matching is desired,
            the appropriate flag (e.g., /i) should be set outside of the regex.

            7. This pattern avoids matching if words are not adjacent or if other
            intervening words occur between ''Triple'' and the ''X''-starting words.

            - The user wants lines where the word ''Triple'' is directly followed
            by words starting with ''X''.

            - ''Directly followed'' is interpreted as one or more consecutive words,
            each starting with ''X'', immediately after ''Triple'' separated by spaces.


            Step 2: Match entire line (anchors ''^'' and ''$'') to ensure full line
            evaluation.


            Step 3: Match the word ''Triple'' as a standalone word using word boundaries:
            \bTriple\b.


            Step 4: Match one or more whitespace-separated words starting with ''X''
            after ''Triple''.

            - Use (?:\s+\bX\w*)+ to represent one or more such words.


            Step 5: Allow arbitrary content before and after by using ''.*'' at start
            and end, ensuring pattern can appear anywhere in the line.


            Step 6: Note about case sensitivity: The regex matches capitalized ''Triple''
            and ''X'' words exactly as given (case sensitive). To change, add relevant
            flags.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''The word Triple Xylophone X-ray is here''

            - Matches: ''Triple Xenon Xe Xylophone''

            - Does not match: ''Triple apple Xray''

            - Does not match: ''triplex Xenon''


            This regex addresses:

            - Multiple consecutive ''X'' words directly following ''Triple''.

            - Avoids improper backtracking by precise grouping.

            - Ensures strict ordering and adjacency of ''Triple'' and ''X'' words.


            If needed, case-insensitive matching can be enabled externally depending
            on regex engine.'
