            either ''ge'' or ''an'' must appear before ''ger'' or ''tra''.

            Step 2: ''Before'' means that the first sequences (''ge'' or ''an'') come
            earlier in the line than the second sequences (''ger'' or ''tra'').

            Step 3: To encode this in regex, we need to enforce that the line contains
            ''ge'' or ''an'' first and, at some later point in the line, ''ger'' or
            ''tra''.

            Step 4: Use a positive lookahead to assert the presence and order. ''(?=.*\b(ge|an))''
            checks for ''ge'' or ''an'' somewhere, and that it comes before ''(?=.*\b(ger|tra))''.

            Step 5: However, the initial regex ''(?=.*\b(ge|an)(?=.*\b(ger|tra)))''
            ensures ''ge'' or ''an'' occurs, and within that positive lookahead, another
            lookahead for ''ger'' or ''tra'' after.

            these should be whole words. If substrings inside words are allowed, ''\b''

            ''e'' then ''din'' or ''ky'' then ''din''.


            Step 2: Since the line can have arbitrary text before and after, we want
            to assert the presence of this pattern anywhere in the line.


            Step 3: Use a positive lookahead to assert that the line contains this
            substring. The lookahead is ''(?=.*(?:e|ky)din)''.


            Step 4: Match the entire line with ''^.*$'' to ensure full line matching.


            Putting it together: The regex is ''^(?=.*(?:e|ky)din).*$''. This will
            match the entire line only if it contains ''din'' immediately following
            the letter ''e'' or the sequence ''ky''.

            Step 5: Repeating this group at least three times with {3,} ensures that
            there are at least three digits, possibly separated by other characters.


            Step 6: We then allow the line to end with any characters (.*).


            Step 7: Anchoring the pattern with ^ at the start and $ at the end ensures
            the regex matches the full line.


            Therefore, the full regex is ^(?:.*\d){3,}.*$ which will match a line
            if it contains three or more digits in any positions.'

            Step 2: Identify the pattern for such words:

            - Words ending with ''ne'' means the word ends with the letters ''ne''

            - The word is longer than ''ne'', so it must have at least one character
            before ''ne''

            - Use word boundaries (\b) to isolate the words


            Step 3: Create the regex for this word:

            - \w+ means one or more word characters

            - So, \w+ne matches words ending with ''ne'', but potentially this includes
            ''ne'' itself.

            - However, ''ne'' itself is two characters, and \w+ means at least one
            character before ''ne'', so minimum length = 3 (e.g., ''one'')


            Step 4: Add boundaries:

            - Use \b to ensure the word is isolated

            - \b\w+ne\b matches words ending with ''ne'' that are longer than ''ne''


            Step 5: Match the entire line:

            Step 3: The word boundary \b ensures we are matching entire words and

            Step 3: ''.*'' matches the rest of the line (any characters zero or more

            Putting this together, the regex is ''^(The|For).*'' which matches lines

            letters (A-Z or a-z). Step-by-step reasoning:


            1. We want to count alphabetical letters within the line.

            2. Letters are characters in the ranges A-Z and a-z.

            3. To match lines that contain at least 5 letters, we can look for 5 occurrences
            of the pattern ''[A-Za-z]''.

            4. Since letters can be separated by any non-letter characters, we use
            ''[^A-Za-z]*'' to skip any non-letters between them.

            5. So, ''(?:[^A-Za-z]*[A-Za-z]){5}'' ensures at least 5 letters appear
            anywhere in order, possibly separated by non-letters.

            6. The ''^'' anchors the pattern to the start of the line to ensure we
            match the entire line.

            7. ''.*$'' at the end matches the remainder of the line after the 5th
            letter to complete the full line match.


            Thus, the regex ''^(?:[^A-Za-z]*[A-Za-z]){5}.*$'' matches any line containing

            from the start of the line (`^`), there is some sequence of characters
            (possibly none) followed by a digit (`\d`). After confirming this, we
            match the entire line with `.*` and anchor at the end with `$` to ensure
            the whole line is matched. This way, only lines containing at least one
            digit are matched in full.

            1. We want to match a full line, so we start the regex with ^ and end
            it with $.

            2. We allow any characters before or after the word, so we can use .*
            before and after.

            3. The word must begin with ''x'' or ''X'' (case-insensitive), so we look
            for a word boundary \b, then [xX] to match ''x'' or ''X''.

            4. After the initial ''x'' or ''X'', the word can have zero or more word
            characters, represented by \w*.

            5. We close the word with another word boundary \b.


            Combining all, we get ^.*\b[xX]\w*\b.*$, which matches any line containing

            \b to mark the start and end of a word and match \w{5,}, meaning 5 or
            more word characters.


            Step 3: Use a positive lookahead (?=...) to assert the existence of such
            a word anywhere in the line. This lookahead is placed at the start of
            the line.


            Step 4: Match the whole line with ^ and $ anchors to ensure we match a
            full line.


            The resulting regex is:


            ^(?=.*\b\w{5,}\b).*$


            - ^: start of line

            length 5 or more

            - .*: match the entire line

            - $: end of line

            distinct words.


            Step 1: Define what a "word" is. Typically, a word is a sequence of word
            characters (letters, digits, underscores) bounded by word boundaries.
            So a word can be matched by \b\w+\b.


            Step 2: We need at least three distinct words. However, with regex alone,
            directly checking for "distinct" words is complicated since regex doesn''t
            support set operations or memory comparison between different words easily.
            In general regex, matching at least three words (not necessarily distinct)
            is straightforward, but checking distinctness is non-trivial.


            Step 3: Given the limitations, a best effort regex to match lines with
            at least three words (not necessarily distinct) would be:

            ^(?:\b\w+\b\W+){2,}\b\w+\b.*$


            Explanation:

            - ^ anchors at start of line.

            - (?:\b\w+\b\W+){2,} matches at least two occurrences of a word followed
            by non-word chars (like spaces or punctuation).

            - \b\w+\b matches the third word.

            - .* matches the rest of the line.

            - $ anchors end of line.


            Step 4: To enforce distinctness purely in regex is not feasible or practical.
            It would require a high-complexity regex with backreferences and negative
            lookaheads and only feasible for small fixed number of words and small
            word sets.


            Hence, this regex matches lines with at least three words, which is close
            to user''s requirement but not exact. Distinctness should be checked programmatically
            outside regex if needed.'

            Step 1: We want to consider the entire line, so we use ^ to anchor the
            start and $ to anchor the end.


            Step 2: We need to ensure there are at least 3 occurrences of ''she''.
            To do this, we can use a non-capturing group containing `.*she` (any characters
            followed by ''she'') repeated at least 3 times.


            This gives (?:.*she){3,} which means: any characters (including none),
            followed by ''she'', repeated 3 or more times anywhere in the line.


            Step 3: We allow any characters after the last occurrence, so we add `.*`
            at the end.


            Thus, the full regex is: ^(?:.*she){3,}.*$ which matches any line containing

            - Non-vowels are any characters except these vowels.

            - [aeiouAEIOU] matches a vowel.

            - The group (?:[^aeiouAEIOU]*[aeiouAEIOU]) repeated exactly 5 times ensures

            - [^aeiou]* matches zero or more characters that are NOT vowels.

            To ensure matching whole words and not substrings like 'Facebooking' or

            1. ''^'' and ''$'' are used to anchor the regex to the start and end of

            4. ''and'' is the literal word we are searching for.

            or more of any characters.

            3. Finally, the line must end with ''o'', so the last character before

            - \b: word boundary to start the word

            - \w+: one or more word characters

            - \b: word boundary to end the word

            - \s*: optional whitespace after the word (spaces or tabs)


            Step 6: Then, repeat this group {3,6} times to allow for 3 to 6 words.


            Step 7: Anchors ensure the entire line contains only these words and optional
            trailing whitespace.


            This leads to the regex: ^\b(?:\w+\b\s*){3,6}$'

            - Use a non-capturing group (?:...) for one occurrence of such a word,
            including the surrounding optional text.

            - Quantify with {3,} to require at least three occurrences.


            Step 5: Anchoring the entire match to the line:

            - ^ and $ to ensure the entire line is matched.


            Hence, the regex ''^(?:.*\b[AEIOUaeiou]\w*\b.*?){3,}.*$'' works by matching
            any line that contains at least three words beginning with a vowel.

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. Words are generally sequences of word characters bounded by word boundaries.

            2. A word ending with ''ge'' means the word has zero or more word characters
            before ''ge'' and then ends (word boundary after ''ge'').

            3. So the pattern for the word is: \b\w*ge\b

            4. The line can have anything before or after this word, so we put .*
            at start and end.

            5. Use ^ and $ anchors to match the full line.


            Therefore, the full regex is: ^.*\b\w*ge\b.*$'

            characters (\w+) with ''ge'' at the end.

            Step 3: Use word boundaries (\b) to make sure we match whole words. So,
            a word ending with ''ge'' is \b\w*ge\b.

            Step 4: The line can have any text before or after this word, so we allow

            Step 3: Words are separated by spaces. A line may have one or multiple
            four-letter words.

            Step 4: The regex should match the whole line, so we use `^` at the start
            and `$` at the end.

            Step 5: The pattern begins with a four-letter word: `[a-zA-Z]{4}`.

            Step 6: Then zero or more occurrences of a space followed by another four-letter
            word: `(?:\s[a-zA-Z]{4})*`.

            Step 7: Combining all: `^(?:[a-zA-Z]{4})(?:\s[a-zA-Z]{4})*$`.

            This regex matches lines that have only four-letter words separated by
            spaces, and no other characters.'

            1. The line must contain at least one ''d'' or ''e'' character.

            2. After that, there must be at least one ''s'' or ''r''.


            To capture this in a regex that matches the entire line, we use lookaheads:


            - `(?=.*[de])`: positive lookahead asserting that somewhere in the line
            is ''d'' or ''e''.

            - `(?=.*[sr])`: positive lookahead asserting somewhere in the line is
            ''s'' or ''r''.


            However, the problem states the ''s'' or ''r'' must come after an instance

            One approach is to write a regex that matches any line where there is

            To achieve this, we can use lookahead assertions:


            1. `(?=.*[de])` asserts that somewhere in the line there''s a ''d'' or

            appear after the first occurrence of ''d'' or ''e''.


            To fulfill this ordering, we can do the following:


            - Use a lookahead to find ''d'' or ''e'', then after it, somewhere later,

            This can be expressed as: `(?=.*[de].*[sr])`

            Both are equivalent; the latter using a lookahead ensures that the full

            2. The line must contain ''d'' or ''e'' anywhere. This can be expressed

            3. The line must also contain ''s'' or ''r'' following the ''d'' or ''e''
            occurrence. To confirm this order, we ensure ''s'' or ''r'' appears somewhere
            after ''d'' or ''e''. However, lookaheads are zero-width and don''t enforce
            order by their position.

            4. To ensure that ''s'' or ''r'' appears after ''d'' or ''e'', we can
            use a single lookahead that looks for ''d'' or ''e'' followed at some
            point later by ''s'' or ''r''. This can be done with: (?=.*[de].*[sr])

            5. Alternatively, to catch all cases where both exist anywhere but ''s''
            or ''r'' comes after ''d'' or ''e'', combining the conditions with order:
            (?=.*[de].*[sr])

            matches any character except newline. The quantifier {3,} matches 3 or
            more occurrences. Anchors ^ and $ ensure we match the entire line, not
            just part of it. Thus, '^.{3,}$' matches any line with at least 3 characters.

            1. We want to match the entire line, so the regex should start with ^
            and end with $ to match the whole line.

            2. We need at least 5 ''d''s in the line. One way to do this is to use
            a repeated group that ensures each ''d'' is matched.

            3. The group (?:[^d]*d) matches zero or more characters other than ''d''
            followed by a ''d''. This ensures we match one ''d'' and any characters
            before it except ''d'' so that each ''d'' is counted individually.

            4. We repeat this group at least 5 times: (?:[^d]*d){5,}

            5. After matching at least 5 ''d''s, there can be additional characters
            (that are not ''d'') at the end, so we allow [^d]* at the end.

            2. In regex, a word boundary can be represented by \b. Using \b ensures

            3. To find such words anywhere in the line, we can use the pattern: \b\w+er\b,

            4. Since the requirement is to match entire lines containing such words,
            the regex should match the whole line.

            5. Therefore, we add ''^.*'' before the pattern and ''.*$'' after it to
            match any characters before and after.


            This gives the final regex: ''^.*\b\w+er\b.*$''. It matches any line containing

            4. The word starts with ''ca'', then can have zero or more word characters
            (letters/digits/underscore), so we use ca\w*.

            5. Then another word boundary \b to ensure the word ends there.

            ''nu'' then matching further to ''dist'' or ''dust''.


            However, there''s a concern with edge cases such as ''dist foo dust nu'',
            where ''dist'' precedes ''foo'', but ''foo'' occurs before ''dust'', and
            then ''nu'' after. The user requires the regex to not match if ''dist''
            or ''dust'' come before any ''foo'' or ''nu''. In other words, the earliest
            occurrence of either word in (''foo'',''nu'',''dist'',''dust'') must be
            from ''foo'' or ''nu'' to match.


            Step-by-step approach:

            1. We need to ensure that the first occurrence of any of these four words
            on the line is either ''foo'' or ''nu''. If the first occurrence is ''dist''
            or ''dust'', no match.


            2. To implement this in regex, use a pattern that consumes from the start
            of line any characters that do not start a word from the set (foo, nu,
            dist, dust).


            3. Then, the first matched word must be ''foo'' or ''nu''.


            4. After this, somewhere later, ''dist'' or ''dust'' must occur.


            Regex form:

            - Start ''^''.

            - Non-greedy consume any characters that don''t start these words: ''(?:(?!\b(?:foo|nu|dist|dust)\b).)*?''

            - Then, ''\b(foo|nu)\b'' matches first occurrence.

            - Then, ''.*'' any characters.

            - Then ''\b(dist|dust)\b'' to match second expected word.

            - Finally, ''.*$'' matches rest of line.


            Final regex:

            ''^.*?(?<!\S)(foo|nu)(?!\S).*\b(dist|dust)\b.*$''


            But to strictly control that the first matched word is ''foo'' or ''nu''
            and that none of ''dist'' or ''dust'' come before it, use negative lookahead
            at start:


            ''^\s*(?:(?!\b(?:dist|dust)\b).)*\b(?:foo|nu)\b.*\b(?:dist|dust)\b.*$''


            Explanation:

            - ''^\s*'' start of line and optional whitespace.

            - ''(?:(?!\b(?:dist|dust)\b).)*'' matches any characters only if they
            are not the start of ''dist'' or ''dust'', ensuring no ''dist'' or ''dust''
            appears before ''foo'' or ''nu''.

            - ''\b(?:foo|nu)\b'' matches ''foo'' or ''nu'' first.

            - ''.*'' any characters zero or more.

            - ''\b(?:dist|dust)\b'' ensure ''dist'' or ''dust'' happens later.

            - ''.*$'' rest of line.


            This correctly prevents matching if ''dist'' or ''dust'' precede ''foo''
            or ''nu''.


            Hence, the recommended regex is:


            ''^\s*(?:(?!\b(?:dist|dust)\b).)*\b(?:foo|nu)\b.*\b(?:dist|dust)\b.*$''


            This satisfies the requirement that ''foo'' or ''nu'' appear before ''dist''
            or ''dust'', line-wide, and respects word boundaries and order strictly.'

            The regex should check if 'ge' or 'an' is immediately followed by either\
            \ 'ger' or 'tra'. Since 'ger' and 'tra' start with 'g' and 't' respectively,\
            \ and 'ge' and 'an' end differently, overlaps matter.\n\nExamples:\n-\
            \ \"antra\" contains 'antra' starting at index 0.\n- Does 'an' immediately\
            \ followed by 'ger' or 'tra' mean substrings like 'anger' or 'antra'?\n\
            \nTo test immediate adjacency, one can check for the pair:\n\n- 'ge' +\
            \ 'r' (to form 'ger')\n- 'an' + 'tra' (to form 'antra')\n\nBut 'ge' +\
            \ 'ger' is not possible; 'ge' is contained in 'ger' itself.\n\nAnother\
            \ way is just to check if the substring contains either of: 'gegen', 'antra',\
            \ 'anger', 'getra'?\n\nIn practice, substrings 'ger' and 'tra' are full\
            \ 3-character substrings, 'an' and 'ge' are 2 characters.\n\nSo immediate\
            \ adjacency is: the substring starting with 'ge' or 'an' immediately continued\
            \ with the rest of 'ger' or 'tra'.\n\nHence possible immediate sequences\
            \ are:\n- 'ger' where the first two characters are 'ge' \u2014 so 'ge'\
            \ immediately precedes 'r', forming 'ger'.\n- 'an' immediately precedes\
            \ 'tra' forming 'antra'.\n\nTherefore:\n- Check for 'ger' where 'ge' immediately\
            \ precedes 'r'.\n- Check for 'antra' where 'an' immediately precedes 'tra'.\n\
            \nThus, allowed sequences are 'ger' and 'antra'.\n\nFor matching 'ge'\
            \ or 'an' immediately before 'ger' or 'tra', the regex can match the sequences:\n\
            \n- 'ger' (starts with 'ge')\n- 'antra' (starts with 'an')\n\nSo instead\
            \ of lookaheads, we can just test for these substrings.\n\nHowever, the\
            \ problem is the line may contain multiple substrings.\n\nThe user wants\
            \ lines containing 'ge' or 'an' before 'ger' or 'tra' (the two substrings\
            \ separately). The interpretation now is immediate adjacency, so the combined\
            \ substrings 'ger' and 'antra' suffice.\n\nBut if they must appear separately\
            \ in the line (like 'ge...' then later 'ger'), that would require the\
            \ prior approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the user hints their problem requires\
            \ immediate adjacency.\n\nFinal regex:\n- Check for lines containing 'ger'\
            \ or 'antra' (the only sequences where 'ge' or 'an' directly precede 'ger'\
            \ or 'tra').\n\nSo:\n```regex\n^(?=.*(ger|antra)).*$\n```\n\nThis matches\
            \ lines containing 'ger' or 'antra'.\n\nThis satisfies:\n- Matches 'antra'\
            \ (contains 'antra')\n- Matches 'angler' (contains 'ger')\n\nTherefore,\
            \ the reasoning is revised to:\n- For immediate adjacency, search for\
            \ 'ger' or 'antra'.\n- This covers 'ge' immediately before 'r' (ger) or\
            \ 'an' immediately before 'tra' (antra).\n\nHence the regex: ^(?=.*(ger|antra)).*$"

            - "geger" should match because ''ge'' is immediately before ''ger''.

            - "strange tra" should match because ''an'' appears before ''tra'' somewhere
            in the line.

            - "ge some text tra" should NOT match because ''ge'' and ''tra'' are separated
            by other words, so ''ge'' is not immediately before ''tra'' or ''ger''.


            Step 2: This implies the requirement is to match lines where either ''ge''
            or ''an'' is immediately followed by either ''ger'' or ''tra'' with no
            characters or words in between.


            Step 3: To do this, the regex needs to find a substring where (ge or an)
            is immediately followed by (ger or tra), i.e., (ge|an)(ger|tra).


            Step 4: The regex `\b(?:ge|an)(?:ger|tra)` ensures that ''ge'' or ''an''
            starts on a word boundary and is then immediately followed by ''ger''
            or ''tra''.


            Step 5: We wrap with ^.* and .*$ or simply use ^(.*\b(?:ge|an)(?:ger|tra))$
            to match the full line containing this pattern anywhere.


            Step 6: This prevents matching lines where ''ge'' is separated by other
            text from ''tra'' or ''ger'', satisfying the third example.

            Step-by-step solution:

            1. Use a positive lookahead to assert the presence of ''ge'' or ''an''

            2. Between ''(ge|an)'' and ''(ger|tra)'', allow any number of characters

            3. The lookahead pattern: ''(?=.*(ge|an).*?(ger|tra))''

            4. Anchor to start of line ''^'' and ensure we match the entire line with

            1. ''meanest'' should match, where ''mean'' directly precedes ''est''

            2. ''nicotest'' should match, where ''nic'' precedes ''test'' with other
            characters in between.

            3. ''demeanest'' should match since ''mean'' inside the word before ''est''
            is valid.

            4. ''niceness test'' should NOT match, because ''nic'' and ''test'' are
            separated into different words. This means the match should look within
            the same continuous substring (word) without intervening spaces.


            Thus, the criteria are:

            - The line should contain a substring where ''mean'' precedes ''est''
            inside the same continuous string (allowing other characters in between).

            - OR the line should contain a substring where ''nic'' precedes ''test''
            inside the same continuous string.


            This effectively means matching lines that contain:

            - ''mean'' followed by ''est'' anywhere after in the same substring (no
            spaces interrupting), or

            - ''nic'' followed by ''test'' similarly.


            The regex explained:

            - `.*` matches any characters before.

            - `mean.*est` matches substring with ''mean'' followed by ''est''.

            - `nic.*test` matches substring with ''nic'' followed by ''test''.

            - The alternation ''mean.*est|nic.*test'' captures either case.

            - We wrap this in a positive lookahead `(?=...)` so the whole line matches
            only if such a substring exists.

            - Anchors `^` and `$` ensure the entire line is matched.


            No word boundaries are used to allow ''mean'' or ''nic'' inside larger
            words (like ''demeanest'').


            This pattern does NOT match if ''nic'' and ''test'' appear in separate
            words (with spaces). Thus ''niceness test'' does not match.

            which should match. They contain ''tain'' after ''tain'' after ''in''
            and ''enter'', respectively. However, the instructions specify ''tain''
            after ''re'' or ''per''. ''maintain'' does not contain ''tain'' preceded
            by ''re'' or ''per'' but by ''main''. ''entertain'' contains ''tain''
            after ''enter'', which ends with ''er''; since there''s no strict ''re''
            or ''per'', only ''er'' reversed, it likely should not match. Given these
            observations, the problem appears to look for lines where the substring
            ''tain'' is preceded by ''re'' or ''per'' anywhere in the line, allowing
            multiple matches per line. Thus, the regex `^(?=.*\b(?:re|per)tain)` still
            covers detecting any occurrence of ''retain'' or ''pertain'' in the line,
            which satisfies the original requirement. Since ''maintain'' and ''entertain''
            do not contain ''tain'' after ''re'' or ''per'', by the problem statement
            they should not match. If the user expects matches for these words because
            of ''Entertain'' and ''maintain'' containing ''tain'' preceded by ''in''
            or ''ent'', that contradicts the ''re'' or ''per'' criteria, so no change
            needed. If the intent is to also match ''tain'' preceded by ''in'' or
            ''enter'', then the problem definition expands. Assuming the problem remains
            as given, the regex correctly matches lines containing ''retain'' or ''pertain''
            (i.e., ''tain'' after ''re'' or ''per'').'

            3. "Exactly 6" means the sequence of 6 letters is not part of a longer

            Regex explanation:

            - ^ and $ mark the start and end of the line.

            - .* matches any characters zero or more times (before and after the target
            sequence), ensuring the sequence can be anywhere.

            - (?<![A-Za-z]) ensures the sequence is not immediately preceded by a
            letter.

            - [A-Za-z]{6} matches exactly 6 letters.

            - (?![A-Za-z]) ensures the sequence is not immediately followed by a letter.


            This ensures the sequence of exactly 6 letters is isolated and present
            somewhere on the line.'

            as a standalone word).


            Previous regex required ''pan'' to be a standalone word ''\bpan\b'', which
            does not account for ''pepperpan'' (where ''pan'' is part of the same
            word ''pepperpan'') or ''panic'' and ''panther'' following later. Therefore,
            we relax the requirement for ''pan'' to appear as a standalone word.


            Step 1: Find a word starting with ''pe'', which is ''\bpe\w*\b''.

            Step 2: Look for ''pan'' occurring later in the line anywhere (no word
            boundaries).


            Use positive lookaheads from the start of the line:

            - (?=.*\bpe\w*\b) ensures a word starting with ''pe'' exists.

            - (?=.*pan) ensures the substring ''pan'' exists anywhere in the line
            after the start.


            Finally, match the whole line with ''.*$'' to cover the rest.


            This regex matches lines like ''pepperpan'' (single word contains ''pe...''

            1. **Order enforcement:** The ''pe''-starting word must appear before
            the word ''pan'' in the line. The original regex only ensured both words
            appeared somewhere, but not the order.


            2. **Case-insensitivity:** Both words should be matched regardless of
            case.


            Step-by-step reasoning to improve the regex:


            - Add the inline case-insensitive flag `(?i)` at the beginning.


            - Maintain the first lookahead `(?=.*\bpe\w*\b)` to ensure the presence

            later by ''pan''. This enforces the order.


            - Anchors `^` and `$` with `.*` consume the whole line.

          reasoning: 'The initial regex ''^.*\b\w*tt\w*\b.*$'' matches any full line
            containing a word with consecutive double ''t''s. For example, ''tt''
            inside the word will match. The edge case ''totter'' should not match
            because it contains ''t'', ''t'' but not consecutive ''tt''. Since ''totter''
            spells ''t-o-t-t-e-r'', the substring ''tt'' does occur consecutively
            (''t'' followed immediately by ''t''), so it should match if our intention
            is any word with letters ''tt'' consecutively. However, the user says
            ''totter'' should not match because it does not have consecutive ''tt''.
            This suggests there may be confusion: the word ''totter'' actually has
            ''tt'' consecutively at indexes 2 and 3 (0-based). The substring ''tt''
            is present at positions 2 and 3. Therefore, ''totter'' does contain the
            substring ''tt'' and should match according to the initial requirements.
            If the user wants to exclude words where ''tt'' is overlapping with other
            letters, or handle something else, that needs clarification. Given the
            user states ''totter'' should not match, presumably implies matching only
            whole words that have ''tt'' at start or end or some other constraint.
            But ''totter'' does have ''tt'' in the middle, so it should match as per
            the original requirement. If the user wants to only match ''tt'' as isolated
            group (not part of longer sequences), that would be different. Because
            the user''s explanation states that ''totter'' has multiple ''t''s but
            no consecutive ''tt'', but in fact it has consecutive ''tt'', maybe the
            user misstates them. If the user actually means words with double letters
            that are adjacent and identical, then ''totter'' should match because
            it has ''tt'' substring. Therefore, the original regex is correct in matching
            words with ''tt'' substring. If the user wants to ensure that the ''tt''
            substring occurs as a separate word or something else, it should be clarified.
            So the previous regex is already correct and will not falsely match words
            without ''tt''. In conclusion, the regex ''^.*\b\w*tt\w*\b.*$'' correctly
            matches lines with words containing ''tt'' substring, including ''totter''.

            and one or more word characters.


            Step 3: We need to find if this word contains at least one vowel. Inside
            the word, the vowels are [aeiouAEIOU]. So a word with at least one vowel
            can be expressed as \w*[aeiouAEIOU]\w*.


            Step 4: To ensure that at least one such word exists anywhere in the line,
            use a positive lookahead: (?=.*\b\w*[aeiouAEIOU]\w*\b).

            .*? was used to allow any characters non-greedily between them.


            In the example "  Yes    Why   ", we have multiple spaces and leading/trailing
            whitespace. The regex as is handles varying whitespace correctly because
            \b detects word boundaries properly regardless of whitespace. The pattern
            \b\w*y\w*\b matches "Yes" and "Why" correctly.


            To make sure the regex is robust, removing the lazy quantifier .*? and
            replacing it with .* also works correctly because the lookahead needs

            1. **Word Boundaries and Punctuation:** Using `\b` word boundaries ensures
            the ''words'' are recognized properly, even when punctuation like commas
            or exclamation marks are attached after the word (e.g., ''library,'').
            The word boundary `\b` matches the transition between word characters
            and non-word characters.


            2. **At Least Two Words Containing ''y'':** The positive lookahead `(?=.*\by\w*\b.*\by\w*\b)`
            ensures that there are two occurrences of words containing ''y'' separately
            in the line. Using `.*` allows for any characters (including spaces and
            punctuation) between these words.


            3. **Matching the Full Line:** Anchoring with `^` and `$` ensures the
            entire line is matched.


            Final regex explanation:

            - `^` start of line.

            - `(?=.*\by\w*\b.*\by\w*\b)` positive lookahead to check there are at
            least two words containing ''y''.

            - `.*` matches the entire line.

            - `$` end of line.


            This meets the requirements and handles given edge cases by effectively

            Explanation:

            - The positive lookahead (?=.*\b\w*ri\w*\b) ensures that such a word exists

            - ^ and $ anchor the regex to match the entire line.


            For the edge case "This line contains no matching substring", since no
            word contains ''ri'', the lookahead will fail and the regex will not match
            the line, which is the correct behavior.

          reasoning: 'The regex "^(?i).*\bthe\b.*$" addresses all provided edge cases
            correctly. Explanation: 1. The inline case-insensitive modifier (?i) makes
            the match case-insensitive, so ''The'', ''the'', ''THE'', etc. are matched.
            2. The word boundary \b around "the" ensures that ''the'' is matched as
            a whole word only, separating it from other words or punctuations. 3.
            Punctuation like ''the!'' is considered a boundary for \b, so ''the!''
            still matches. 4. Anchors ^ and $ ensure the match applies to the entire
            line. 5. The .* on either side allows ''the'' to be anywhere in the line.
            This regex correctly matches all given examples: "The quick brown fox...",

            ''ei''.

            To handle matching ''ei'' regardless of case (i.e., ''ei'', ''EI'', ''Ei'',
            ''eI''), we add an inline case-insensitive modifier ''(?i)'' at the start
            of the regex.


            Steps:

            1. Add ''(?i)'' to enable case-insensitive matching.

            To handle case variations like 'Artistic' and 'Artistically', we add the
            inline case-insensitive flag '(?i)' at the start of the regex. This allows
            matching 'art' regardless of casing anywhere within the line. Since 'party'
            contains 'a', 'r', 't' but not in sequence as 'art', it won't be matched
            by 'art' substring matching. Thus, this adjusted regex matches lines containing
            'art' in any case and position, ensuring correct behavior for the provided
            examples.

            match ''blog'' as a whole word only. However, examples like ''blogging''
            and ''weblog'' contain ''blog'' as part of larger words, and the user

            to allow matching ''blog'' as a substring anywhere within the line.


            2. Case insensitivity: The user wants matches regardless of case, e.g.,
            ''Blog'' with uppercase ''B''. To handle this, we add the inline case-insensitive
            modifier `(?i)` at the start.


            3. Full line match: The entire line should be matched if ''blog'' appears

            with ''ia''. It uses ''^'' to anchor the start and ''$'' to anchor the
            end of the line, ensuring the string ends exactly with ''ia''. In the
            provided edge case ''iatopia'', it will not match since ''iatopia'' ends
            with ''ia'' but only after some other characters, implying the line ends
            with ''ia''. Actually, ''iatopia'' ends with ''ia'', so it should match.
            However, the user indicates it should not match. Since ''iatopia'' does
            end with ''ia'', it rightly should match if the goal is lines ending with
            ''ia''. If ''iatopia'' is not to match because ''ia'' is inside the word
            but not the entire ending, then the problem might be misunderstood. If
            the user wants ''ia'' as the very last characters, then ''iatopia'' ends
            with ''ia'' so it should match. Possibly the intention is to match lines
            that end with ''ia'' as a whole word, not as part of another word like
            ''iatopia''. In that case, we need to ensure that ''ia'' occurs as a whole
            word ending the line, e.g., preceded by a non-word character or start
            of line. The regex can be modified to ''^.*\bia$'' to ensure ''ia'' is
            a whole word at the end. So, updated regex: ''^.*\bia$''.'

            it does not match because the line ends with ''e'' in the word ''juice''
            which is also the last character of the line. However, since ''juice''
            ends with ''e'', and the entire line also ends with ''e'', it should match.
            If the user expects ''orange juice'' to fail because it starts with ''o''
            (valid vowel start) and ends with ''e'' (valid end), but it does not satisfy
            some other condition or expects regex to treat trailing spaces, that needs
            clarification.


            If there are trailing spaces or newline characters, the regex should consider
            them and ensure the line ends directly with ''e''. So if the line has
            trailing spaces, those would cause the regex to fail. To handle optional
            trailing whitespace, one could modify the regex to ignore trailing spaces
            by allowing optional spaces before end-of-line anchor: ''^[AEIOUaeiou].*e\s*$''.
            But the user requested lines ending with ''e'', so trailing spaces are
            likely not allowed.


            Therefore, the regex ''^[AEIOUaeiou].*e$'' correctly matches lines starting
            with vowels and ending exactly with ''e''. It matches ''orange juice''
            because it ends with ''e''. If the user wants to avoid matching lines

            Step 3: The regex uses a positive lookahead ''(?=.*news.*(paper|show))''
            to ensure ''news'' occurs earlier in the line than either ''paper'' or
            ''show''. This enforces the ordering.


            Step 4: The anchors ''^'' and ''$'' ensure the entire line is matched.


            Step 5: This regex passes the edge cases: It matches ''newspaper is interesting''
            because ''news'' comes before ''paper'' in ''newspaper'', and does not
            match ''paper news show'' because ''news'' appears after ''paper''.


            Hence, the regex is ''^(?=.*news.*(paper|show)).*$''.'

            6. The regex ''^.*(?i)\by[a-z]{5}\b.*$'' would not be valid because inline

            words like ''ING'' in uppercase, we add the case-insensitive inline modifier
            ''(?i)'' at the beginning of the regex.

            Step 2: Word boundary ''\b'' and ''\w+ing\b'' requires the word to end
            exactly in ''ing''. ''bringings'' ends with ''ings'', which does not satisfy
            the last boundary after ''ing'', so won''t match with this regex.

            Step 3: The user seems to want to match words ending strictly with ''ing'',
            so words like ''bringings'' (ending with ''ings'') should not match since
            the word ending isn''t exactly ''ing''. However, if the user wants to
            include words ending with ''ings'' (like ''bringings''), we would need
            to relax ending constraints.

            Step 4: Since the prompt''s explanation states ''bringings'' should match,
            we take it as acceptable to match words that end with ''ing'' as a substring
            and allow suffixes after ''ing''. So ''bringings'' ends with ''ings'',
            which also contains ''ing'' as substring ending at position 5, but not
            as word ending.

            Step 5: To accommodate this, we remove the trailing word boundary ''\b''
            to allow suffixes after ''ing''. But then we must ensure ''ing'' is at
            the end of the word or at least part of it.

            Step 6: The user wants lines that contain at least one word ending with
            ''ing'' (with or without suffixes like ''s''), so ''bringings'' should
            match. The best way is to match any word containing ''ing'' as suffix
            sequence, possibly followed by other letters. That means ''\b\w+ing\w*\b''.

            Step 7: Adding the case-insensitive modifier and anchoring to full line,
            the regex becomes ''^(?i).*(\b\w+ing\w*\b).*$''.

            after this word.


            3. Anchoring the regex with ^ and $ ensures the entire line is matched.

            itself which is valid, but could also cause misinterpretation in some
            engines. To ensure we only match words that end with 'ot', and the word
            boundary \b correctly marks the end, we use \w+ot to require at least
            one character before 'ot'. This excludes substrings not ending with 'ot'.
            For example, in 'plot', since 'plot' ends with 'ot', it matches correctly.
            If the word is 'plottage', it doesn't end with 'ot' so won't match. Therefore,
            the regex uses a positive lookahead to find at least one word ending with

            Step-by-step reasoning:


            1. We need to identify words starting with ''q''. A word boundary \b ensures
            that we match the start of a word.

            2. The character ''q'' immediately following the word boundary ensures
            the word starts with ''q''.

            3. \w* matches zero or more word characters following ''q'', allowing
            for the rest of the word.

            4. Another word boundary \b ensures the word ends after those characters.

            5. The pattern is embedded in .* at the beginning and end to allow any
            characters before and after the target word in the line.

            6. Anchors ^ and $ ensure the entire line is matched.

            a sequence of word characters; in this case, starting with ''q''.


            Step 3: So, a word starting with ''q'' can be expressed as ''\bq\w*\b''.
            This pattern matches a word boundary, then ''q'', then zero or more word
            characters, then another word boundary.


            Step 4: Since the regex should match the full line if it contains such
            a word anywhere, we can wrap this with ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' to allow any

            \ with lowercase i. But then 'wi-Fi' ends with uppercase 'i' so does not\
            \ match.\n\nBut more importantly, we want to only count words fully alphanumeric\
            \ without hyphens, so that 'wi-Fi' is not considered a word ending with\
            \ 'i', only 'wi' and 'Fi' parts considered words.\n\nThe user suggests\
            \ that the word boundary is splitting 'wi-Fi' into 'wi' and 'Fi', but\
            \ since 'Fi' ends with uppercase 'i' no match, but 'wi' ends with 'i'\
            \ lowercase and would cause a match.\n\nHence, the regex must exclude\
            \ words if they are inside a hyphenated word.\n\nOne possible solution\

            \ 'Fi' is immediately preceded by a hyphen, so exclude it.\n\nTo exclude\
            \ words that are not bounded by word boundaries but by hyphens.\n\nHence,\
            \ the word character sequence must be bounded by word boundaries that\
            \ are not adjacent to hyphens.\n\nWe can define word boundaries as those\
            \ that are not adjacent to hyphens:\n- The character before the word should\

            \ eel' should match because 'eel' contains 'e's but no 'c', however, 'cat'\
            \ contains 'c' but no 'e'. So actually, no single word contains both 'c'\
            \ then 'e' after it. The user example explanation suggests clarifying\
            \ that the regex should check words separately and match if any word contains\
            \ 'c' followed later by 'e'. The example actually contains no such word,\
            \ so 'cat eel' should NOT match.\n- 'czechoslovakia' does have 'c' before\
            \ 'e' in some parts (looking at the substring 'czech...'), but the first\
            \ 'c' appears before the 'e' immediately, so it should match as per the\
            \ initial interpretation, but the user says it should NOT match as the\
            \ letter 'e' does not come after 'c' in this word - likely meaning the\
            \ 'e' comes before some 'c' but no 'c' directly before an 'e'. For clarity,\
            \ the letter sequence in 'cze' is 'c'(at pos 0), 'z'(pos1), 'e'(pos2)\
            \ meaning 'e' comes after 'c' here, so logically 'c' then 'e' exists in\
            \ order. \n\nGiven the user's explanation, we need to ensure the regex\
            \ matches only if there exists a 'c' which is *before* an 'e' in the word,\
            \ i.e., any 'c' comes before any 'e' in the same word.\n\nStep 3: Reconsidering\
            \ the original regex \\b\\w*c\\w*e\\w*\\b:\n- This matches any word containing\
            \ a 'c' somewhere before an 'e'.\n\nStep 4: The issue is if in 'czechoslovakia'\
            \ the user expects NO match, then possibly the user wants 'e' immediately\
            \ following 'c' or 'e' right after a 'c' without other letters between.\
            \ But the problem says 'letter \"e\" appears after letter \"c\"' anywhere\
            \ after, so original regex is correct per problem statement.\n\nStep 5:\
            \ Since user's explanation for 'cat eel' is that it should match due to\
            \ 'e' after 'c' if considering the entire line, but original problem says\
            \ per word, so the regex correctly scans words. The regex scans words\
            \ separately using word boundaries \\b. So 'cat' does not have an 'e',\
            \ 'eel' has 'e's but no 'c'. So 'cat eel' as a line does NOT have a word\
            \ with 'c' then 'e'.\n\nStep 6: Clarify that the correct interpretation\
            \ is that ONLY individual words containing the pattern count; mixing letters\
            \ across words is invalid.\n\nStep 7: Final regex explanation:\n- Use\
            \ a positive lookahead to confirm at least one word contains 'c' before\
            \ 'e'\n- \\b\\w*c\\w*e\\w*\\b matches a full word with 'c' then 'e' in\

            \ edge cases given the initial specifications.\n\nIf the user requires\
            \ additional constraints (e.g., ensure 'e' is immediately after 'c'),\

            including spaces, tabs, and so on, to handle the first edge case.

            Step 4: This approach does not count non-word tokens because only sequences
            of \w+ are considered words, so symbols or punctuation are excluded as
            words.

            Step 5: Anchored at start (^) and ensuring the entire line is matched
            with optional following characters (.*$) confirms the line has at least
            seven words.

            This regex addresses both edge cases by requiring seven proper words separated

            Pattern explanation:

            - The line must contain at least three different words: we try to capture

            - \"apple 123 apple!\" effectively sees words 'apple', '123', and 'apple'\

            and allowed.


            The existing regex \^(?:[^aeiou]*[aeiou]){5}[^aeiou]*$ already allows
            any non-vowel characters (including digits, special characters, punctuation,
            etc.) as [^aeiou]* matches zero or more non-vowel characters.


            Hence, the regex is correct and does match the example:


            - It matches ''e'', then ''a'', then ''e'', then skips ''5!'' (non-vowels),
            then matches ''i'', then skips '';'', then matches ''o'', then matches
            ''u'' => total 5 vowels.


            Therefore, the existing regex covers the edge case correctly.

            If there is any deviation, ensure the regex is applied with case-insensitivity
            if uppercase vowels need to be included (use (?i)^...). As the user didn''t
            specify case-sensitivity, assuming lowercase vowels is acceptable.

          reasoning: 'The previously provided regex did not ensure exactly one 3-letter
            word per line due to how words and word boundaries were handled.


            Key improvements needed:

            1. Correctly count words of exactly 3 letters using word boundaries (\b).

            2. Allow punctuation around words, but count words as sequences of word
            characters only (\w).

            3. Hyphenated words should be considered as separate words split at hyphen
            (treat hyphen as non-word character).

            4. Match the entire line, ensuring exactly one word matches the 3-letter
            count.


            Plan:

            - Use negative lookahead to ensure that no second 3-letter word exists
            after the first.

            - Use a pattern that matches words as sequences of word characters bounded
            by word boundaries.

            - Allow any other characters (including punctuation) but these should
            not interfere with the word count.


            Final regex:

            - ^ Start anchor.

            - (?:[^\w]*\b(?:\w{1,2}|\w{4,})\b[^\w]*)*  : zero or more non-3-letter
            words, possibly with punctuation.

            - \b\w{3}\b    : exactly one 3-letter word bounded.

            - (?:[^\w]*\b(?:\w{1,2}|\w{4,})\b[^\w]*)*   : zero or more non-3-letter
            words, possibly with punctuation.

            - $ End anchor.


            This ensures exactly one 3-letter word in the entire line, and other words
            are not 3 letters, counted via word boundaries and word character class.


            Examples:

            - "a cat!" matches because exactly one 3-letter word ''cat''.

            - "the cat sat" does not match because two three-letter words (''the'',
            ''cat'', ''sat'').

            - "hi cat dog" does not match (two three-letter words).

            - "cat-cat cat" does not match as it contains two three-letter words.


            This covers the edge cases and defines a precise word boundary and count
            criteria.'

            - The line ''queue'' contains two ''q''s: the first character ''q'' and

            - The regex part (?:[^q\n]*q){2,} matches sequences where zero or more

            - In ''queue'', the first ''q'' matches the first group''s ''q'', then

            and end with ''$''.

            2. We need to ensure there are at least two occurrences of ''z''.

            3. We use a non-capturing group (?:[^z]*z) to find one occurrence of ''z''
            preceded by any number of non-''z'' characters.

            4. We require at least two such occurrences: (?:[^z]*z){2} matches two
            occurrences of ''z''

            5. After two occurrences, the line can have zero or more characters, so
            we add .* to match the rest of the line.

            2. The regex should check the entire line from start (^) to end ($).

            3. To ensure there are at least two ''z''s, we use a repeated pattern

            4. Repeating this pattern at least two times: (?:[^z]*z){2,} means at
            least two occurrences of a ''z'', each possibly preceded by non-''z''

            Hence, the previous regex adequately handles lines like ''9'' or ''10''
            only if the requirement is lines containing either number. Since the user''s
            example states these should match, it suggests the requirement might be
            lines containing either ''9'' or ''10''.


            Final conclusion: clarify that to match lines containing the numbers ''9''
            and ''10'' as whole numbers simultaneously, the regex is `^(?=.*\b9\b)(?=.*\b10\b).*$`.


            To match lines containing either ''9'' or ''10'' as whole numbers, including
            lines with only ''9'' or only ''10'', the regex is `^.*\b(9|10)\b.*$`.


            Thus, the edge cases ''9'' and ''10'' alone are correctly matched with
            the ''either'' regex.'

          reasoning: 'The original regex used word boundaries (\b), which incorrectly
            allowed matches in cases like ''9.10'' and ''9,10''. This is because ''\b''
            considers punctuation as a word boundary, so numbers joined by ''.'' or
            '','' were treated as separate tokens.


            To fix this, we refine the lookaheads to ensure that ''9'' and ''10''
            appear as separate whole numbers, and are not parts of decimal numbers
            or digit sequences joined by ''.'' or '',''.


            We use negative lookbehind and negative lookahead to ensure that the ''9''
            or ''10'' is not immediately preceded or followed by digits, dot, or comma
            characters:

            - (?<![\d.,]) asserts that before the number there is no digit, ''.''
            or '',''

            - (?![\d.,]) asserts that after the number there is no digit, ''.'' or
            '',''


            This prevents matching ''9'' inside ''9.10'' or ''9,10'', because ''9''
            is followed by ''.'' or '','' in those cases.


            The final regex:

            - ^ anchors the start of line

            - (?=.*(?<![\d.,])9(?![\d.,])) ensures ''9'' is present as a separate

            number

            - .* matches the rest of the line

            - $ anchors the end of line


            This meets the requirement to only match lines with ''9'' and ''10'' as
            whole numbers properly separated from digits and decimal/comma separators.'

            is surrounded by spaces, but the edge case suggests understanding whether
            ''trolls'' must be preceded by whitespace or start of line, and followed
            by whitespace or end of line. The explanation says ''some trolls here''
            shouldn''t match because the word ''trolls'' is preceded by a space but
            not followed by exactly a space (since it''s followed by ''here''). Actually
            ''some trolls here'' contains '' trolls '' only if ''trolls'' is preceded
            and followed by whitespace. However, if we interpret the original requirement
            more strictly as ''trolls'' must have spaces around it, meaning the characters
            before and after ''trolls'' are spaces, then ''some trolls here'' actually
            should match (has spaces before and after ''trolls''). But since the user
            says ''some trolls here'' should NOT match, we deduce that ''trolls''
            must be an entire word surrounded by spaces, but not part of other words,
            and must be on its own or surrounded by only spaces, no extra words adjacent
            to it? To interpret carefully, maybe the user wants the word ''trolls''
            to be matched ONLY if it is the entire line surrounded by spaces or by
            line start and line end. So we revise the regex to make sure that the
            word ''trolls'' is either the entire line or surrounded only by spaces
            with no other words around it.


            Therefore, ''some trolls here'' includes other words before and after
            ''trolls''. If that''s not allowed, we must match only lines where ''trolls''
            is alone or surrounded only by spaces.


            So the regex requires to match lines where the entire content is spaces
            and ''trolls'' and spaces. This means: start of line ^, optional spaces
            \s*, then ''trolls'', then optional spaces \s*, and end of line $.


            Hence, the regex becomes: ''^\s*trolls\s*$''


            This regex matches lines that contain only ''trolls'' surrounded by zero
            or more spaces (spaces before and after). It will not match lines where
            ''trolls'' is embedded in other words or surrounded by other words such
            as ''some trolls here''.

            Step 4: To handle the edge cases, especially to reject lines where ''betty''

            Step 3: Use three positive lookaheads:

            - (?=.*\bugly\b) ensures the word ''ugly'' exists somewhere in the line.

            Step 4: .* in the lookaheads and outside matches any characters between

            Example: ''ugly. Betty is here'' matches because ''ugly'' and ''betty''
            are whole words with punctuation allowed.


            Example: ''Uglyness is different from ugly and betty'' does not match

            of either ''betty'' or ''thomas'', but it did not verify that ''ugly''
            appears before the first occurrence of either word.


            Steps to fix:

            1. The line must contain ''ugly'' somewhere: `(?=.*\bugly\b)` (positive
            lookahead).

            2. The line must contain either ''betty'' or ''thomas'' somewhere: `(?=.*\b(betty|thomas)\b)`
            (positive lookahead).

            3. To enforce ''ugly'' is before the **first** occurrence of either ''betty''
            or ''thomas'', we add a negative lookahead `(?!.*\b(betty|thomas)\b.*\bugly\b)`
            which forbids ''betty'' or ''thomas'' occurring before ''ugly''.

            4. Finally, check that ''ugly'' occurs before ''betty'' or ''thomas''
            with `.*\bugly\b.*\b(betty|thomas)\b.*`.


            This combination ensures:

            - Both words are in the line.

            - ''ugly'' occurs before any occurrence of ''betty'' or ''thomas''.

            - Lines where ''betty'' or ''thomas'' come before ''ugly'' do not match.

            after ''mae''.


            Step 3: The regex ''\b\w*mae\b'' captures any word ending exactly with
            ''mae''. ''llama'' will not match because it ends with ''ama''.


            Step 4: To handle uppercase or mixed case variations (like ''Female''),
            we should apply case-insensitive matching. This is typically done using
            the inline modifier ''(?i)'' at the start of the regex.


            Step 5: Wrapping with ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' allows the whole line to be
            matched if the word is anywhere in the line.


            Hence, incorporating case-insensitivity, the regex becomes: ''^(?i).*\b\w*mae\b.*$''.
            This matches full lines containing words ending with ''mae'' regardless
            of case, and differentiates from words like ''llama''.'

            3. A word boundary on both sides ensures ''ru'' appears inside a full
            word, capturing words like ''Abruptly'', ''room'', ''Ruby'', and ''Run''.

            4. The positive lookahead (?=.*\b\w*ru\w*\b) ensures the line contains

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. ''^'' and ''$'' anchors denote the start and end of the line.

            2. ''.*'' matches any characters leading up to the final character.

            3. We want to ensure the last letter is a single lowercase ''f'' and not

            4. To achieve this, we use a negative lookbehind ''(?<!f)'' before the
            final ''f'' ensuring the character before the last ''f'' is not an ''f''.
            This prevents matching lines that end with ''ff''.


            This regex matches lines where the final character is a single lowercase

            Finally, we ensure the line ends with 'f' by placing 'f' before the end-of-line

            Also, the user wants to ensure that we match words "email" and "spam"

            least a two-letter sequence, the regex looks specifically for two consecutive
            alphabetic letters (a-z or A-Z).


            The user gave two examples:

            - ''a1b2'' which contains letters separated by digits but no two letters
            consecutively; thus, ''a1'' and ''1b'' do not form letter-letter pairs,
            so this line should not match if the requirement is strictly two consecutive
            alphabetic letters.


            - ''a!b@'' also does not contain any two consecutive alphabetic letters.


            The user''s explanation suggests verifying if the line has any two-letter
            sequence regardless of context (letters only) or any two consecutive characters.


            Since the original problem statement says "lines that have at least a
            single 2 letter sequence", it is natural to assume it means alphabetic
            letters only, i.e., two consecutive letters.


            If the user intends to match any two consecutive characters regardless
            of being letters, then the regex would be: ^.*(.{2}).*$ which matches
            any two characters in a sequence.


            However, because the original statement references "2 letter sequence"
            (which ordinarily means alphabetic letters), the original regex remains
            valid.


            In conclusion, ''a1b2'' and ''a!b@'' do NOT contain two consecutive letters
            as per standard definition, so they should NOT match.


            If the user wants to match any two consecutive characters regardless of
            being letters, please clarify.

            b to find words ending with 'ti'. However, hyphenated words like 'multi-ti'\
            \ present a challenge because the segment 'ti' is preceded by a hyphen,\
            \ which is not a word character, so \\b matches the boundary between hyphen\

            \ word, causing 'multi-ti' to incorrectly match. The user says such hyphenated\
            \ segments ending with 'ti' should NOT match.\n\nStep 3: To avoid matching\
            \ 'ti' when it's part of a hyphenated segment, we need to define word\
            \ boundaries to exclude the hyphen as a boundary for the ending segment.\n\
            \nStep 4: One approach is to not consider the hyphen as a word boundary.\
            \ The \\b metacharacter matches between a \\w (word character) and a \\\
            W (non-word character).\n\nStep 5: Since hyphens are non-word characters,\
            \ \\b will match between a hyphen and a word character, meaning 'ti' in\
            \ 'multi-ti' is considered a separate word, causing a match.\n\nStep 6:\
            \ To prevent matches on hyphenated last segments, we can require that\
            \ before the word boundary at the end, the preceding character is a word\
            \ character, but not a hyphen.\n\nStep 7: We can assert that before the\
            \ \\b there is no hyphen before 'ti'. Use a negative lookbehind for hyphen\
            \ before 'ti'. Something like (?<!-)\\b\\w*ti\\b.\n\nBut the lookbehind\
            \ here should be before the 'ti'. That is, before 't' there should not\
            \ be a '-'. So the word should not be preceded by a hyphen.\n\nStep 8:\
            \ The whole word ends with 'ti' preceded by zero or more word characters,\
            \ but no hyphen immediately before the 't'.\n\nStep 9: So, to implement\
            \ this:\n- Match a word boundary at the start \\b\n- Followed by zero\
            \ or more word characters \\w*\n- Followed by 't' that is NOT immediately\
            \ preceded by a hyphen (negative lookbehind)\n- Followed by 'i'\n- Followed\
            \ by a word boundary \\b at the end.\n\nHowever, word characters include\
            \ letters, digits and underscore. Hyphen is non-word character.\n\nStep\
            \ 10: Alternatively, since hyphen is non-word character, the \\b boundary\
            \ applies between hyphen and word char. So 'ti' at the end of hyphenated\
            \ word is after boundary. We need to ensure the word before 'ti' does\
            \ not contain hyphens.\n\nStep 11: For simplicity, let's instead match\
            \ words that consist only of word characters (letters/digits/underscore)\
            \ ending with 'ti'. The negative lookbehind (?<!-) before the 't' may\
            \ not be sufficient if 'ti' is preceded by another character.\n\nStep\
            \ 12: Simplify to ensuring the matched word contains only \\w characters\
            \ (no hyphen), ends with 'ti'. So the full word is \\b\\w*ti\\b, and since\
            \ hyphen is not in \\w, hyphen separated parts are not matched as a single\
            \ word.\n\nStep 13: So the original pattern already excludes hyphenated\
            \ word segments as words ending with 'ti' because hyphen is not a word\
            \ character, so two separate words exist 'multi' and 'ti'. The segment\
            \ 'ti' in 'multi-ti' is a separate word and would match, which is a problem.\n\
            \nStep 14: To prevent this, require that the matched word is at least\
            \ two characters long, and the whole word is matched (which it is, with\
            \ \\b\\w*ti\\b). Since 'ti' alone is also \\w*ti, the segment 'ti' would\
            \ match as a separate word.\n\nStep 15: However, in 'multi-ti', the 'ti'\
            \ segment after hyphen is a standalone word 'ti', it matches the regex,\
            \ which we want to avoid.\n\nStep 16: To prevent matches on 'ti' segments\
            \ that appear after hyphen, we can assert that the character before the\
            \ word boundary is not a hyphen.\n\nStep 17: So before the \\b (end of\
            \ word), let\u2019s add a negative lookbehind to disallow hyphen before\
            \ 'ti'. Something like:\n  (?<!-)ti\\b\n\nBut something like 'anti' ends\
            \ with 'ti' and is preceded by 'n' which is not hyphen, so allowed.\n\n\
            Step 18: So final regex pattern:\n  (?i)^.*\\b\\w*(?<!-)ti\\b.*$\n\nStep\
            \ 19: This ensures the word ending with 'ti' is matched except when 'ti'\
            \ is immediately preceded by a hyphen.\n\nStep 20: This meets both requirements:\
            \ case insensitive, excludes 'multi-ti'.\n\nIf more strictness is desired\
            \ (ex: not match standalone 'ti' after hyphen as a separate word), more\
            \ context-aware parsing is needed, but for regex this is the best compromise."

            1. "The antihero arrived late." - The regex will not match because "antihero"
            is a single word that ends with ''hero'', not ''ti''. There is no separate
            word "anti" in the sentence; the substring ''anti'' inside ''antihero''
            is not considered a separate word due to word boundaries.

            2. "I love pi!" - The word "pi" does not end with ''ti'' (it''s only ''p''
            and ''i''), so it won''t match either.


            Thus, no modification to the regex is needed because it correctly matches
            whole words ending with ''ti'' and does not match substrings within longer
            words or words that do not end with ''ti''.


            If there''s any misunderstanding, users should ensure the input text tokens
            are separated by standard word boundaries for the regex to work correctly.'

            The example ''JJjJjjj'' has multiple uppercase ''J''s and lowercase ''j''s.
            The problem does not specify case insensitivity, so matching is case sensitive
            by default.


            In the string ''JJjJjjj'', the lowercase ''j''s count as:

            - Positions: 3rd character ''j'', 6th character ''j'', 7th character ''j''

            There are at least three lowercase ''j''s, so the line should match.


            If the example suggests it should NOT match because uppercase ''J''s are
            present, then it implies the line should only contain lowercase ''j''s,
            possibly ignoring or disallowing uppercase ''J''. However, the problem
            does not say that.


            Since the problem is to match lines with at least three lowercase ''j''s
            regardless of other characters (including uppercase), the previous regex

            If we wanted to ensure only lowercase ''j'' counts, the regex is already
            case sensitive. Uppercase ''J''s are not counted.


            Therefore, the regex ''^(?:[^j]*j){3}.*$'' matches lines with at least
            three lowercase ''j''s, which aligns with the problem.

            designed to be applied per line, so it does not count ''j''s across multiple
            lines.


            To explicitly ensure that the regex does not span multiple lines and only
            matches within a single line, we adjust the character classes to exclude
            newline characters explicitly, by using [^j\n] instead of [^j]. This helps
            avoid any confusion in some regex flavors when dot or character classes

            Final regex explanation:

            - ^ and $ anchors assert start and end of a line.

            For example, in ''umbrella.'', ''umbrella'' is \bumbrella\b and the ''.''
            is outside the word boundary.


            Step 2: We need to match lines that have two or more such words.


            Step 3: Use a positive lookahead to check if the line contains at least
            two words ending in ''a''. The lookahead: (?=(?:.*\b\w*a\b){2,}) ensures
            that the pattern \b\w*a\b appears at least twice when scanning from the
            start.


            Step 4: Then match the whole line with ^.*$ to match any characters across
            the entire line.


            This regex correctly matches lines with two or more words ending with
            ''a'', excluding punctuation as part of the word.


            Testing with edge cases:

            - ''She read about the idea, schema, and dilemma.'' matches because ''idea'',
            ''schema'', and ''dilemma'' are recognized correctly without punctuation.

            - ''Anna bought an umbrella.'' does not match because only one word (''Anna'')
            ends with ''a'' and ''umbrella'' has a trailing ''.'', making it not counted
            as a word ending in ''a''.


            Therefore, the regex is: ^(?=(?:.*\b\w*a\b){2,}).*$'
          regex: ^(?=(?:.*\b\w*a\b){2,}).*$

            like 'Launchpad' and only matches words ending precisely with 'ch' like
            'launch' or 'beach'. Therefore, the regex ^.*\b\w*ch\b.*$ correctly handles

            However, in the example "should not match", the word ''match?'' ends with
            ''ch'' followed by ''?'', which is punctuation. In regex, a word boundary
            ''\b'' occurs where a word character is next to a non-word character or
            the string boundary. Since ''?'' is a non-word character, ''\b'' will
            match there, so words like ''match?'' correctly count as ''match'' ending
            with ''ch'' followed by punctuation.


            Therefore, the original regex ''^.*\b\w*ch\b.*$'' already matches words
            ending with ''ch'' even if immediately followed by punctuation, because
            the word boundary accounts for that.


            If the concern is that the input like ''should not match'' contains ''match?''
            but you want to ensure ''ch'' at the end of a word ignoring trailing punctuation,
            the current regex handles it correctly.


            Hence, no modification needed as the regex correctly handles words ending
            in ''ch'' even with trailing punctuation since the word boundary ''\b''
            includes punctuation as boundary.

            Step 2: Prior solution used \w which includes letters, digits, and underscores.
            The problem examples show words with punctuation, so we must match only
            alphabetic letters, excluding digits/underscores.


            Step 3: Using \b (word boundary) ensures that the 7 letters are a whole
            word, not part of a longer word.


            Step 4: Using [A-Za-z]{7} matches exactly 7 letters (upper or lower case).

            Testing against edge cases:

            - "The quick brown...": no 7-letter words (quick and brown are 5 or 6
            letters), so no match.

            - "Looking, feelings; and heights": "Looking" and "heights" are 7 letters
            and correctly matched using \b considering punctuation.

            - "abcd efghijk lmnopqrst uvwxyz": "efghijk" is exactly 7 letters and
            matched.


            Hence, this regex correctly detects lines with words of exactly 7 letters

            three occurrences of [A-Z].

            3. To do this, we can use a non-capturing group (?:[^A-Z]*[A-Z]) that

            4. Repeating this group three times ensures presence of at least three
            capital letters in the line: (?:[^A-Z]*[A-Z]){3}.

            5. After these three capital letters, the line can have any characters,
            including zero characters, so append .*.

            6. The ^ and $ anchors ensure matching the entire line.

            Step 2: We use the positive lookahead ''(?=.*\bfu\w*)'' to assert that

          reasoning: 'The original regex used ''\w'' which matches only letters, digits,
            and underscore, and treats hyphens (''-'') as non-word characters, thus
            separating ''mid-day'' into two words (''mid'' and ''day''). However,
            the user provided an edge case ''mid-day'' which should be treated as
            a single hyphenated word containing ''d'' in its middle.


            Step 1: Understand that hyphens should be considered part of words, meaning
            word boundaries ''\b'' alone do not suffice because ''\b'' matches between
            ''\w'' and ''\W'', and ''-'' is non-''\w'', thus breaking words at hyphens.


            Step 2: To properly treat hyphenated words as single words, we modify
            the regex to include hyphens as word characters, by using a character
            class ''[\w-]'' instead of ''\w''.


            Step 3: Change ''\b'' boundaries with caution. Since ''\b'' considers
            hyphens as word boundaries, to simulate word boundaries including hyphens,
            we keep ''\b'' but extend inside the word to include hyphens in the allowed
            characters.


            Step 4: In the lookahead, look for a pattern:

            - ''\b'' to mark start of the word (note this might partially break with
            hyphens but best we can do in regex)

            - ''[\w-]*'' zero or more word or hyphen characters

            - ''\w+'' before ''d'' ensures at least one letter before ''d'' (making
            sure ''d'' is not at the start)

            - ''d''

            - ''\w+'' at least one letter after ''d'' (ensuring ''d'' is not at the
            end)

            - ''[\w-]*'' zero or more word/hyphen characters (rest of the word)

            - ''\b'' end of word


            Step 5: Use this pattern within a positive lookahead to assert existence
            of such a word anywhere in the line.


            Step 6: Match the entire line with ''^'' and ''$'' anchors.


            This regex matches full lines containing at least one hyphenated word
            (or normal word) with ''d'' appearing not at the start or end.


            Example: ''mid-day'' contains a hyphenated word, and ''d'' appears in
            the middle, so the regex matches it.'

            Since the problem states ''followed anywhere by s or r'', the ordering
            implies ''d'' or ''e'' must be before ''s'' or ''r'' in the line. However,
            the assertions as above do not ensure order - they only verify presence.


            To ensure order (d or e before s or r), we need a pattern that ensures

            the pattern to \b[a-zA-Z]{3}\b. This defines a word boundary, then exactly
            three letters (upper or lowercase), then another word boundary.

            This improved regex correctly handles:

            - ''A quick brown fox jumps.'' matches because ''fox'' is a 3-letter alphabetic
            word despite the trailing period.

            - ''Go! Run! Now!'' matches because ''Run'' and ''Now'' are 3-letter alphabetic
            words despite exclamation.

            - ''123 4567 890'' does not match because these are digits only, not alphabetic
            words.


            Note: If the user expects ''Go! Run! Now!'' to not match because of punctuation,
            that conflicts with the logic of words ending in punctuation; here punctuation
            is outside word boundaries, so words like ''Run'' should match. If excluding
            such cases is needed, further regex adjustments would be necessary, but
            current interpretation is that words are alphabetic sequences bounded

            \ word boundaries (\\b), which exactly match positions between \\w (alphanumeric\
            \ and underscore) and \\W (non-word characters). \n\nIn \"way!\", the\
            \ boundary between 'y' and '!' is a word boundary because 'y' is a word\
            \ character and '!' is not. Therefore, \\b[a-zA-Z]{3}\\b will correctly\
            \ match \"way\" even if it is followed by punctuation.\n\nTesting against\
            \ \"No way!\":\n- \"No\" is 2 letters, does not match.\n- \"way\" is 3\
            \ letters, and \\b[a-zA-Z]{3}\\b matches it properly.\n\nSince the user\
            \ expects that \"No way!\" should not match and states the explanation\
            \ that 'way' is three letters, the user likely meant that punctuation\
            \ should be excluded or that words can be affected by punctuation.\n\n\
            However, the standard \\b word boundary should correctly identify \"way\"\
            \ despite punctuation.\n\nIf the user does want to ignore punctuation\
            \ attached to words, i.e., treat \"way!\" as \"way\" and still count that\
            \ as a word, then the current regex is sufficient.\n\nIf the user wants\
            \ to disallow words where punctuation is attached, meaning only letters\
            \ surrounded by spaces or line boundaries count, then we need a different\
            \ approach.\n\nGiven the explanation, the user says \"No way! -> should\
            \ not match\" meaning that the word \"way\" with exclamation makes the\
            \ word invalid. So we need to exclude matches where the 3-letter word\
            \ is immediately followed or preceded by punctuation.\n\nBut since \\\
            b counts punctuation as non-word character, the current \\b assertions\
            \ are correct. \n\nAlternatively, the user might want matches only for\
            \ fully pure alphabetic words separated by spaces or line start/end, not\
            \ immediately adjacent to punctuation.\n\nTo enforce that, we can build\
            \ our own word boundaries using lookarounds:\n- At the start: either line\
            \ start or a whitespace\n- At the end: either line end or a whitespace\n\
            \nSo instead of \\b, do (?<![a-zA-Z]) for start and (?![a-zA-Z]) for end\n\
            \nBut then \"way!\" ends with punctuation, so (?![a-zA-Z]) matches (next\
            \ character is '!') so it passes.\n\nIf we want to exclude words attached\
            \ to punctuation at end, we can do:\n- The character after the three letters\
            \ must be either whitespace or end of line (not punctuation).\n\nWe can\
            \ modify the regex to only match if the 3-letter word is surrounded by\
            \ spaces or start/end of line. \n\nSo for 3-letter word:\n- Preceded by\
            \ start of line or whitespace\n- Followed by end of line or whitespace\n\
            \nSo the lookahead is:\n(?=.*(?:^|\\s)[a-zA-Z]{3}(?:\\s|$))\n\nThis would\

            case ''Only consonants and vowels here.'' should not match because no
            word ends with ''on''. The previous regex requires at least one word character
            before ''on'' (\w+), which is correct; ''Only'' and ''here'' do not end
            with ''on'', so they don''t satisfy this, and the regex would not match
            such lines. Therefore, the original regex already handles this correctly
            and does not match the line, which is desired.\n\nIn the edge case explanation,
            ''Only consonants and vowels here.'' does not contain any word ending
            with ''on'', so it should not match, and the original regex ''^.*\b\w+on\b.*$''
            behaves correctly. Changing ''\w+'' to ''\w*'' might allow words like
            ''on'' (just ''on''), which is acceptable since ''on'' is a valid word
            ending with ''on''.\n\nHence, the regex ''^.*\b\w+on\b.*$'' or ''^.*\b\w*on\b.*$''
            matches lines with at least one word ending with ''on''. Both are acceptable;
            the addition of ''\w*'' also allows single word ''on''. No modification
            is needed to restrict or allow consonants or vowels specifically since
            ''\w+'' matches any word characters (letters, digits, underscore). The
            user must clarify if only letters (no digits) are allowed, but the problem
            states ''word'', so digits are typically not included.\n\nIf we want to
            match only alphabetic characters (letters a-z, A-Z) ending with ''on'',
            we can refine the regex to ''^.*\b[a-zA-Z]*on\b.*$''. This ensures words
            ending with ''on'' consist of letters only.\n\nSummary: Original regex
            is correct to match lines with words ending with ''on''. Edge case ''Only
            consonants and vowels here.'' does not match as expected. However, if
            the user wants to ensure words are strictly alphabetic, we can suggest
            ''^.*\b[a-zA-Z]*on\b.*$''.'

            examine the edge cases:


            - "Her journey was epic." contains the word ''Her'' which ends with ''er'',
            so the line should match if the regex matches word-ending ''er''. However,
            the user says it should not match because ''Her'' ends with ''er'' but
            is part of another word? Actually, ''Her'' is a separate word ending with
            ''er'', so matching it is correct. But the user says it should *not* match,
            which may indicate the user wants to exclude words like ''Her'' or ''journey''
            (which contains ''er'' but does not *end* with ''er''). However, ''Her''
            does end with ''er'' if we consider word boundaries.


            - "She whispered softly." contains ''whispered'' (ends with ''ered''),
            so the line should *not* match because it does not end exactly with ''er''.
            Our regex only matches words ending exactly with ''er'' due to \b after
            ''er'' which defines a word boundary. So ''whispered'' will not match.


            Given the user instructions, the initial regex ^(?=.*\b\w*er\b).*$ correctly
            matches lines with words ending exactly with ''er''. The first test case
            is confusing since ''Her'' ends with ''er'', so it''s correct that the
            regex matches the line. Possibly the user means that ''Her'' should not
            count because the word is only two letters?


            If the user wants to match only words longer than 2 letters ending with
            ''er'' (i.e., not match ''Her''), we can refine the regex to only match
            words with at least three letters ending with ''er''.


            Modification:

            - Change \w* to \w{1,} to indicate at least one character before ''er'':
            \b\w{1,}er\b.


            This will ignore two-letter words like ''Her'' (which has only one character
            before ''er'').


            Therefore, the updated regex is: ^(?=.*\b\w{1,}er\b).*$


            This satisfies:

            - "Her journey was epic." will not match (2 letters word, not matched)

            - "She whispered softly." also will not match since ''whispered'' ends

          reasoning: 'The original regex used `\b\w*er\b` to find words ending with
            ''er'', but this treats digits and underscores as word characters, which
            leads to matches in cases like ''Server123''. To handle the edge cases:


            1. Handle hyphenated words like ''gamer-boy'': Hyphen should not be included
            in word boundaries, so words with hyphens ending with ''er'' should not
            match unless the entire token ends with ''er''. Our regex with word boundaries
            `\b` correctly excludes hyphenated words because the hyphen breaks word
            boundaries.


            2. Handle words with digits after ''er'' like ''Server123'': To avoid
            matching ''Server123'' as ending with ''er'', we restrict the matching
            to words consisting of only letters before ''er'' to ensure ''er'' is
            at the end of the alphabetic word. That is, `[a-zA-Z]+er`.


            3. Word boundaries match places between `\w` and `\W`. Since digits are
            `\w`, the boundary won''t apply in ''Server123'', so using `\b` and letters
            only before ''er'' ensures only words that end alphabetically with ''er''
            are matched.


            Thus, `\b[a-zA-Z]+er\b` matches words ending exactly with ''er'' and consisting
            only of letters. The positive lookahead `(?=.*\b[a-zA-Z]+er\b)` ensures
            there''s at least one such word in the line, and `^.*$` matches the entire
            line.


            This regex will match lines containing at least one alphabetic word ending
            with ''er'' (e.g., ''player''), will not match lines containing hyphenated
            words ending with ''er'' (e.g., ''gamer-boy''), and will not match words
            with trailing digits after ''er'' (e.g., ''Server123'').


            Note: Regex can''t distinguish part of speech, so ''Her'' matches. If
            excluding pronouns is required, that would need filtering beyond regex.'

        output:
          reasoning: 'The user''s feedback highlights several important considerations:


            1. Case Insensitivity: The user expects lines starting with uppercase
            ''Z'' words to be matched, so we need case-insensitive matching. Rather
            than using inline modifiers which might be restricted, we can explicitly
            include both ''z'' and ''Z'', or rely on regex flags. For Python, if running
            the regex with the re.IGNORECASE flag, it will handle this. If not possible,
            include both cases in character classes.


            2. Hyphenated Words: "zip-zap" is one word separated by a hyphen but both
            parts start with ''z''. The regex should treat hyphenated words as single
            words, only if the entire sequence starts with ''z'' and any hyphen-separated
            segment also starts with ''z''. That means matching words like "zip-zap",
            "zone-zero" etc. We must allow optional "-z\w*" sequences after the initial
            "z\w*".


            3. Leading and trailing whitespace: The user wants to match lines with
            leading and trailing spaces/tabs. Hence, allow optional whitespace at
            start and end (using \s*).


            4. Entire Line Match: The entire line must be made up of one or more such
            words (possibly separated by whitespace), no other characters.


            Putting it all together:

            - Start with optional whitespace: ^\s*

            - Match one or more words, each word starts with ''z'' or ''Z'' (case-insensitive),
            followed by zero or more alphanumerics: z\w*

            - Allow the word to be hyphenated by additional segments that also start
            with ''z'' or ''Z'': (?:-z\w*)*

            - Between words, allow one or more whitespace characters: \s+

            - Repeat this word pattern one or more times

            - Allow trailing whitespace: \s*$


            Final regex:

            ^\s*(?:z\w*(?:-z\w*)*\s*)+$


            This regex assumes the regex is used with case-insensitive matching (e.g.,
            re.IGNORECASE flag in Python). If inline modifiers are forbidden and flag
            use isn''t possible, then modify to [zZ] instead of ''z''. But per instructions,
            inline modifiers only at beginning; since the user requested step-by-step

          reasoning: 'The previous regex used word boundaries around ''son'' and ''soon'',
            which prevented matching when these sequences appear inside longer words
            (like ''Susan'' or ''surprise''). However, the user clarified that ''son''
            or ''soon'' appearing anywhere (inside words as substrings) should count,
            and similarly ''su'' should be matched anywhere after that, even inside
            longer words.


            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. Match lines where ''son'' or ''soon'' appear anywhere: ''so?n'' captures
            ''son'' and ''soon'' (the ''o'' is optional).

            2. Match lines where ''su'' appears somewhere later in the line (after
            the occurrence of ''son'' or ''soon'').

            3. To ensure ''son'' or ''soon'' occurs before ''su'', we can use a single
            lookahead to assert ''so?n'' followed by ''su'' later.

            4. Therefore, the lookahead pattern is: ''(?=.*so?n.*su)''

            5. The regex anchors the line start ''^'' and end ''$'', matching the
            full line.

            6. The regex is: ''^(?=.*so?n.*su).*$''


            This regex matches any line where ''son'' or ''soon'' appears anywhere,
            followed later by ''su'' appearing anywhere after that, without the restriction
            of word boundaries.'

            1. Ensure ''son'' or ''soon'' appears before ''su'' in the line.

            2. ''son'' or ''soon'' should be a separate word to avoid partial matches
            (e.g., ''soonest'' is not the target, but depending on requirements, word
            boundaries help clarify).

            3. Confirm that ''su'' appears somewhere after ''son'' or ''soon''.


            The regex explanation:

            - ^.* : matches from the start of the line any characters.

            - \b(son|soon)\b : matches ''son'' or ''soon'' as whole words.

            - .*su.* : matches any characters after that, then ''su'', then any characters.

            - $ : end of line.


            This regex ensures that ''son'' or ''soon'' appears first (due to the
            greedy match before \b(son|soon)\b), followed somewhere later by ''su''.


            Test for the edge cases:

            - ''soon there is no su here'' : No ''su'', so no match.

            - ''su comes before son'' : ''son'' appears after ''su'', so due to the
            order constraint, no match.

            To ensure we only match complete words and not substrings inside other

            Step 2: We want lines where ''son'' or ''soon'' appears, followed somewhere
            later by ''su''. The order matters: first ''son'' or ''soon'', then ''su''.

            Step 3: Use lookaheads to ensure presence of ''son'' or ''soon'', and
            ''su'' somewhere later.

            However, we need to ensure ''su'' appears after ''son'' or ''soon''.

            Step 4: The lookahead (?=.*\bson\b|.*\bsoon\b) ensures the line contains

            Step 5: The lookahead (?=.*su) ensures ''su'' exists somewhere.

            enforce that ''su'' comes after ''son'' or ''soon''.

            Step 7: One approach is to use a lookahead that finds ''son'' or ''soon'',
            then .* (any characters), then ''su''.

            Thus: (?=.*\b(son|soon)\b.*su)

            Step 9: To simplify, we can remove ending .*$, just keep ^ and use a lookahead
            and match the entire line.

            word start.

            - ''an aluminum can'' should match as ''alu'' in ''aluminum'' is a substring
            starting with ''a''.

            - ''alpha'' should match due to ''alp'' substring.


            From the above, the requirement is to find any substring of length 3 starting

            1. Use ''\b'' (word boundary) to ensure the 3-letter string is not part

            the substring ''app'' is inside a longer word.

            3. The regex becomes ''\ba[a-zA-Z]{2}\b'' to match a standalone 3-letter

            Step 2: The example "y y y y y" should not match if spaces separate the
            ''y'' characters (if "contiguous" means consecutive characters).

            Step 3: However, the user also wants lines like "Yesterday, the yellow
            yolk spilled." to match, so counting ''y''s globally across the line.

            Step 4: The problem is the definition of "contiguous"; the user now clarifies
            that counting should be global (not necessarily several ''y''s in a row),
            ignoring spaces.

            Step 5: Actually, the user states "y y y y y" should not match; because
            ''y'' characters are separated by spaces - so probably contiguous means
            without spaces, which conflicts with the other example.

            Step 6: Given this, the working assumption is to count the number of ''y''
            letters ignoring spaces; that is, only count letters ''y'' and ''Y'',
            but if any spaces separate the ''y''s, they count as separate characters.

            Step 7: To count ''y''s anywhere in the line globally (regardless if contiguous
            or not), we can match lines that contain at least five ''y'' letters.

            Step 8: The issue: "y y y y y" has five ''y'' letters but separated by
            spaces; the user wants to not match this case. This implies they want
            five or more ''y''s contiguous without spaces.

            Step 9: On the other hand, the second example has scattered ''y''s but
            counts; so the problem statement is somewhat inconsistent.

            Step 10: To resolve the inconsistency, since the user provided the two
            cases and explanation, we assume they want five or more ''y'' letters
            anywhere in the line, ignoring spaces, so that "Yesterday, the yellow
            yolk spilled." matches, but the line "y y y y y" with spaces between ''y''
            letters should not match, perhaps because spaces are interrupting the
            count.

            Step 11: So the regex should check for at least five ''y'' or ''Y'' characters
            in the line which are not separated by spaces (contiguous), meaning at
            least five consecutive ''y''s.

            Step 12: To count scattered ''y''s (non-contiguous), the original solution
            is correct. To require contiguous ''y''s, use ''y{5,}'' or ''Y{5,}'' or
            both with case insensitive flag.

            Step 13: But the example "Yesterday, the yellow yolk spilled." does not
            have five contiguous ''y''s, so it wouldn''t match this.

            Step 14: Therefore, to fulfill both examples, add a regex that matches
            lines with five or more ''y'' letters anywhere for the general case, but
            excludes lines where ''y''s are separated by spaces only, i.e., lines
            consisting only of ''y'' and spaces and no other characters should not
            match.

            Step 15: Alternatively, since the example "y y y y y" has only five ''y''s
            separated by spaces, and no other characters, we can exclude lines that
            contain only ''y'' and spaces and no other characters.

            Step 16: So final regex in two parts:

            - matches lines with at least five ''y''s (case-insensitive)

            - negative lookahead that excludes lines consisting only of ''y'' and
            spaces.


            Final regex:

            ^(?![yY ]+$)(?:[^yY]*[yY]){5,}.*$


            Explanation:

            - (?![yY ]+$) : Negative lookahead rejecting lines with only ''y'' or
            spaces

            - (?:[^yY]*[yY]){5,} : At least five occurrences of ''y'' or ''Y'' anywhere

            - .* : The rest of the line

            - ^ and $ : anchor line start and end


            This way, "y y y y y" doesn''t match (only ''y'' and spaces), but "Yesterday,
            the yellow yolk spilled." matches (has other characters besides ''y''
            and spaces and at least five ''y''s).'

            Step 4: The user points out ''y y y y y'' should not match. But actually,
            this line has five ''y'' characters separated by spaces. Since the spaces
            are not ''y'', the count of ''y'' is still five. So actually, it should
            match per the original requirement. The user wants to confirm if spaces
            should affect counting; since the request said "lines which contain five
            or more ''y''", every ''y'' counts regardless of spacing or other characters.


            Step 5: To clarify, the regex must count all ''y'' characters anywhere
            on the line, no matter what else is around.


            Step 6: Therefore, the original regex already enables that.


            Step 7: The only change is to explicitly exclude newline in the character
            class to avoid matching across lines.


            Step 8: The regex is ^(?:[^y\n]*y){5,}[^y\n]*$ which matches lines containing

            is not requested in the original instruction.

            to the start and end of the line, ignoring the newline character itself.
            Thus, a line like "B\n" in the input will be matched by ^[A-Z]$ because
            the regex engine treats ^ and $ as line boundaries, not string boundaries.


            If the user wants to ensure that only a single uppercase letter and no
            other characters (including whitespace or newline) is present, they typically
            need to either strip newline characters before matching or explicitly
            manage the input.


            Given that, the regex ^[A-Z]$ is correct to match lines that contain exactly
            one uppercase letter only, excluding any other characters.


            If the input string literally includes a trailing newline, the matching
            function should use the MULTILINE flag or split the input into lines first
            and then apply this regex to each line separately.

            4. The pattern [a-zA-Z]h will match any two-character sequence where the

            The key part is matching the word 'hairy' as a whole word, so we use word
            boundary anchors \b before and after 'hairy'. This ensures that we don't
            match substrings like 'hairyish' or 'shairy'. Thus, '^.*\bhairy\b.*$'

          reasoning: 'The initial regex \bhairy\b was designed to only match the word
            ''hairy'' as a standalone word and not as part of another word or with
            trailing characters (like ''hairy''s''). The word boundaries \b ensure
            this.


            The example ''The hairy''s color is unusual.'' contains the word ''hairy''s'',
            which is ''hairy'' plus a possessive suffix ''s''. Because the possessive
            form is connected to the word without a non-word boundary, the \b (word
            boundary) fails after ''hairy'', so the regex does not match.


            If we want to exclude such cases (i.e., match only standalone word ''hairy''),
            the regex ^.*\bhairy\b.*$ is correct.


            If we wanted to include possessive or plural forms (like ''hairy''s''
            or ''hairys''), we would have to adjust it.


            Since the user specified that the example should not match, the original
            regex ^.*\bhairy\b.*$ properly excludes possessive forms.

            Looking at the cases:

            - ''munsec'' should not match because ''mun'' appears before ''sec''.
            The regex ''^.*sec.*mun.*$'' won''t match because it expects ''sec'' first,

            Explanation of the regex:

            - ''^'' asserts the start of the line.

            - ''.*sec'' matches any characters followed by ''sec''.

            - ''.*mun'' matches any characters followed by ''mun'' after ''sec''.

            - ''.*$'' matches the rest of the line.


            Therefore, this regex matches lines where ''sec'' appears somewhere before
            ''mun''. It doesn''t require the words to be standalone, so ''museum''
            containing ''mun'' is acceptable.


            Testing edge cases:

            - ''munsec'': ''sec'' doesn''t appear before ''mun'', so no match.

            - ''the sec went to the museum'': ''sec'' appears earlier, then ''mun''
            appears in ''museum'', so match.

            Explanation:

            - The regex allows any characters before and after the word, meaning it
            matches even if the line is just one word.

            - The word boundary and \w*n ensure that any word ending with ''n'' is
            matched.


            Therefore, lines consisting of a single word ending with ''n'' (such as
            ''winner'') are correctly matched with this regex.


            No changes are needed to handle the edge case described.'

      - generation_time: 7.891841888427734
        output:
          reasoning: 'The initial regex \b\w*n\b matches words that end exactly with
            ''n'' with word boundaries on both sides. However, it does not consider
            punctuation immediately following the word, such as a period or comma.


            In the example "Nothing here.", the word "Nothing" ends with ''n'' but
            is followed by a period, so the word boundary \b after ''n'' does not
            consider this as a word boundary due to the punctuation.


            Step 1: We keep the word boundary at the start \b to ensure the start
            of the word.


            Step 2: To account for possible punctuation after the word, we allow an
            optional punctuation character immediately following the word that ends
            with ''n''. We define this optional punctuation as [.,!?;:'']? to cover
            common sentence-ending punctuation marks.


            Step 3: The rest of the line can be anything, so we keep .* before and
            after.


            Step 4: Anchors ^ and $ ensure matching the entire line.


            Thus, the final regex is ^.*\b\w*n\b[.,!?;:'']?.*$ which matches lines

            1. **Case-insensitivity**: The inline modifier `(?i)` is added at the
            start to allow matching ''Therefore'' in any capitalization (e.g., ''therefore'',
            ''THEREFORE'').


            2. **Leading whitespace**: `\s*` after the line start anchor `^` allows
            matching lines with zero or more whitespace characters (spaces or tabs)
            before ''Therefore''.


            3. **Whole word matching**: `Therefore\b` ensures ''Therefore'' is matched
            as a whole word, preventing partial matches inside longer words like ''Thereforefore''.


            4. **Line anchoring**: The regex matches the entire line from start `^`
            to end `$`. This is typically helpful if the entire line is to be validated
            or matched.

            matching ''ger'' or ''tra''.


            Step 3: To capture this in regex, we can match from the start of the line:

            the pattern starts from the beginning, the .* preceding (?:ger|tra) will
            consume characters until reaching ''ger'' or ''tra''. For ''ge'' or ''an''
            to appear before ''ger'' or ''tra'', they must come earlier in the line.


            Step 5: The full regex is anchored with ^ and $ to match the entire line.


            Step 6: Examples:

            - "management training" matches because ''an'' appears in ''management''

            - "target scene" does not match because ''ger'' appears after ''ge'' in
            ''target'', but ''an'' does not come before ''ger'' or ''tra''. Actually
            here, ''ger'' is in ''target'' which also contains ''ge'' before ''ger'';
            but since ''ge'' is in ''target'' at pos 1 and ''ger'' at pos 3, ''ge''
            is before ''ger'' so it matches.

            (e.g., ''linkedin'' or ''kurt'') are acceptable.


            To address this, the regex removes the word boundaries and looks for any
            occurrence of ''lin'' or ''ku'' as substrings.


            The pattern `^(.*(?:lin|ku).*ser.*)$` matches the entire line (`^...$`)

            - `.*(?:lin|ku)` matches any characters leading to an occurrence of either

            This enforces that ''ser'' occurs after the first appearance of ''lin''
            or ''ku'', not just anywhere in the line.


            Regarding multiple occurrences:

            - If ''ser'' appears before ''lin'' or ''ku'', it won''t match since the

            Regex explanation:

            - `(?i)` at the start makes the match case-insensitive.

            - `\b` ensures a word boundary; there must be non-word characters or string
            start/end before and after.

            - `(re|per)` matches either ''re'' or ''per''.

            - `tain` is the literal substring following.

            - Final `\b` ensures the word ends after ''tain''.

            exactly 6 letters (a-z or A-Z). This sequence must not be part of a longer
            letter sequence.


            Step 1: A regex like [a-zA-Z]{6} matches six consecutive letters but also
            matches longer sequences where six or more letters appear consecutively.


            Step 2: To ensure the sequence is exactly 6 letters long (not 7 or more),
            we use lookarounds:

            - Negative lookbehind (?<![a-zA-Z]) ensures no letter directly precedes
            the 6-letter sequence.

            - Negative lookahead (?![a-zA-Z]) ensures no letter directly follows the
            6-letter sequence.


            Hence the core pattern is:

            (?<![a-zA-Z])[a-zA-Z]{6}(?![a-zA-Z])


            This matches exactly six letters that are not preceded or followed by
            another letter, therefore exactly 6 consecutive letters.


            Additional notes:

            - Anchors (^ or $) and leading/trailing .* are not necessary unless matching
            the entire line exactly.

            - This pattern is intended for use in searching within lines to find a
            qualifying 6-letter word.


            Regex flavor considerations:

            - Lookahead assertions (?!...) are widely supported.

            - Lookbehind assertions (?<!...) need fixed width and are supported in
            most modern regex engines like Python''s ''re'' module (since Python 3.6),
            .NET, and others.

            - If lookbehind is not supported, alternative approaches involving capturing
            groups or manual boundary checks are needed, but are more complex.


            Edge case handling:

            - If the 6-letter sequence is at the line start, the lookbehind (?<![a-zA-Z])
            matches because nothing precedes it (start of string).

            - Similarly, at line end, (?![a-zA-Z]) succeeds as there''s no following
            letter.


            Examples:

            - "abcdef" matches (exactly six letters).

            - "abcde" does not match (too short).

            - "abcdefg" does not match because the 7-letter sequence contains a 6-letter
            run but is part of a longer sequence.

            - "123 abcdef 456" matches because "abcdef" is exactly 6 letters surrounded
            by non-letter characters.

            - "abcde123" does not match (only 5 letters before digits).


            Test this regex on various lines to confirm it correctly detects exactly
            six-letter sequences.'

            The improved regex uses a positive lookahead `(?=.*\b[a-zA-Z]{6}\b)` that

            Assumptions:

            - A ''character'' includes any visible or non-visible character except
            newline characters (\n).

            - Lines are treated as sequences of characters between newline delimiters,

            - The regex is applied in an environment where matching is done line-by-line.


            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. Use `.` to match any character except newline.

            2. Use the quantifier `{4,}` to require at least 4 such characters.

            3. Use anchors `^` and `$` to match from the start to the end of the line,

            Examples:

            - "" (empty line): does not match.

            - "abc" (3 characters): does not match.

            - "abcd" (4 characters): matches.

            - "line with spaces" (many characters): matches.


            Note:

            - In multiline strings, this regex will match each line individually if
            the regex engine supports line-by-line matching or if multiline mode is
            enabled.

            - If lines contain carriage return characters (\r), those will be counted
            as characters unless removed beforehand.

            \ match the whole line, they are still present here because the user requested\

            \ when the word is adjacent to punctuation such as 'word,' or 'word.'\
            \ since word boundary matches the transition from word characters to non-word\
            \ characters.\n\n5. **Unicode Word Boundaries:** Standard `\\b` works\
            \ for ASCII word characters and may fail with unicode characters in many\
            \ regex engines. Handling full Unicode word boundaries depends on the\
            \ regex engine's capability (e.g., in Python `re` module `\\b` does not\
            \ perfectly handle some unicode scenarios). More advanced handling would\
            \ require engine-specific features or third-party libraries.\n\n**Example\
            \ matches:**\n- 'This line contains the word.'  \u2192 matches\n- 'WORD\
            \ is here'  \u2192 matches (case insensitive)\n- 'Swordfish is a fish'\
            \ \u2192 does not match (because 'word' is only part of 'Sword')\n- 'A\
            \ word, with punctuation!' \u2192 matches\n\n**Usage notes:**\n- Replace\
            \ 'word' with the target word for use.\n- Use this regex with a regex\
            \ engine that supports inline flags and word boundaries.\n\nIf matching\

          reasoning: The updated regex ensures that a word starting with 'pe' appears
            before the word 'pan' on the same line. By matching from the start '^',
            then any characters '.*', followed by a word boundary '\b', 'pe\w*' to
            match a word that starts with 'pe', another word boundary '\b' to end
            that word, then again any characters '.*' to allow any content before
            the next word. Then comes the '\bpan\b' to match the whole word 'pan',
            followed by any characters and the end of line '$'. This structure enforces
            the order, as 'pe...' word must occur before 'pan'. The use of '\b' on
            both words ensures full word matching, avoiding partial matches. This
            approach addresses the previous issue where the two lookaheads were independent
            and unordered.

          reasoning: 'The goal is to match entire lines containing a word that starts
            with ''pe'' followed somewhere later by the word ''pan''. Ensuring order
            here is critical.


            1. We need to find a word boundary (\b), then ''pe'', then zero or more
            word characters (\w*), then another word boundary (\b), representing a
            word starting with ''pe'': \bpe\w*\b.


            2. Next, somewhere later in the line after this word, there must be the
            word ''pan'' as a whole word: \bpan\b.


            3. To ensure ''pe...'' appears before ''pan'', we use a single positive
            lookahead that captures both sequentially: (?=.*\bpe\w*\b.*\bpan\b).


            4. Anchoring the regex with ^ at the start and $ at the end ensures that
            the entire line is matched when the condition is true.


            5. This differs from using two separate lookaheads (e.g., (?=.*\bpe\w*\b)(?=.*\bpan\b))
            which do not guarantee the ordering of ''pe...'' before ''pan''. By using
            a single lookahead chaining these together, we enforce that ordering.


            6. Note: The regex is case-sensitive by default. If case-insensitive matching
            is required, an inline modifier like (?i) can be added at the start.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "We found pebble near the pan" (pe... before pan).

            - Does not match: "Pan was put beside the pebble" (pan before pe...).


            Thus, the final regex correctly enforces that a word starting with ''pe''
            occurs somewhere before the word ''pan'' in the line.'

            accented characters and Unicode letters in words. Using ''\p{L}'' matches
            any Unicode letter, which is more inclusive.


            Step 3: We use word boundaries ''\b'' to ensure we match whole words starting
            with ''ki'' (case-insensitive), followed by zero or more Unicode letters.


            Step 4: The pattern ''ki\p{L}*'' ensures that after ''ki'', zero or more
            letters (Unicode letters) can appear.


            Step 5: Since the user wants to match lines containing such words, we
            keep ''^'' and ''$'' anchors and ''.*'' at start and end so the entire
            line matches if it contains the target word anywhere.


            Note: This regex assumes the regex engine supports Unicode property classes
            (\p{L}) and inline case-insensitive flag ''(?i)''. Adjust accordingly

            finding lines containing the pattern; searching for ''\bki\p{L}*\b'' suffices.
            2. Added ''(?i)'' inline modifier at the start to make matching case-insensitive,
            so words like ''Kiwi'', ''KING'', or ''kiwi'' are matched. 3. Replaced
            ''[a-zA-Z]*'' with ''\p{L}*'' to support Unicode letters (including accented

            ensures the presence of three or more occurrences of ''sw'' anywhere in
            the line without consuming characters.


            Within the lookahead, ''.*?'' is a non-greedy quantifier to avoid excessive
            backtracking and overlapping matches, improving performance and correctness.
            The pattern ''(?:.*?sw){3,}'' means: any characters minimally followed
            by ''sw'', repeated at least three times to guarantee three distinct occurrences.


            After confirming the condition with lookahead, we match the entire line

            If case-insensitivity is required, the regex engine''s ''ignore case''

            - ''swswsw'' matches (3 ''sw''s)

            - ''sw sw sw'' matches

            so the regex counts 2 non-overlapping ''sw'', so it would not match (correctly
            detects less than 3 distinct occurrences).


            This approach balances performance and correctness for matching at least
            three occurrences of ''sw'' in a line.'

            Step 1: We anchor the regex with ''^'' and ''$'' to match the full line.


            Step 2: The core part is ''(?=(?:.*?sw)){3,}'' which uses a positive lookahead
            repeated at least 3 times.

            - ''(?=...)'' asserts that the pattern inside can be matched starting
            from the current position without consuming characters.

            - ''.*?sw'' matches any characters non-greedily followed by ''sw'', ensuring
            minimal consumption before ''sw''.

            - Repeating this lookahead at least 3 times with ''{3,}'' checks that
            there exist at least 3 ''sw'' sequences in the line.


            Step 3: After the lookaheads, ''.*$'' consumes the full line (to complete
            full line match).


            This construction allows counting overlapping occurrences correctly since
            lookaheads do not consume characters, enabling overlapping matches to
            be evaluated separately. For example, in ''swswsw'', three overlapping
            ''sw'' sequences appear starting at positions 0, 2, and 4; the lookahead
            repetition will recognize these.


            Limitations: Some regex engines may not support repeating lookahead assertions
            with variable minimum counts; Python''s ''re'' module supports it. Also,
            complex lines and extremely long input can impact performance due to multiple
            lookahead evaluations.

            - ''swswsw'' -> matched (3 overlapping ''sw'' sequences)

            - ''swxxsw'' -> no match (only 2 ''sw'' sequences)

            Here, '.' matches any character except newline by default. Since lines

            with the exact sequence ''ch''.


            Step-by-step reasoning:


            1. We need to match whole lines, so the regex should account for the entire
            line.

            2. The line should contain at least one word ending in ''ch''. A word
            is typically defined as a sequence of word characters (letters, digits,
            or underscore).

            3. To match a word ending with ''ch'', we want a word boundary (\b) before
            the word, then zero or more word characters (\w*), followed by ''ch'',
            and then another word boundary (\b) to ensure the word ends there.

            4. Because the line may contain other characters before and after this
            word, we can wrap it with ''.*'' at the start and end to allow any characters
            before and after.

            5. The ''^'' and ''$'' at the beginning and end anchor the regex to the
            full line.


            Putting it all together, the regex is:

            ^.*\b\w*ch\b.*$


            This matches any line containing at least one word ending with ''ch''.'
          regex: ^.*\b\w*ch\b.*$

        output:
          reasoning: 'Step 1: The main goal is to match lines containing at least
            one word ending with the exact sequence ''ch''.


            Step 2: Previously, the regex used ''\b\w*ch\b'', but ''\w'' typically
            covers only ASCII letters, digits, and underscore, which excludes Unicode
            letters and may miss accented characters. To fix this, we use Unicode
            character properties ''\p{L}'' (letters) and ''\p{N}'' (numbers) which
            cover all Unicode letters and digits.


            Step 3: Also, words can contain apostrophes and hyphens (e.g., "o''clock",
            "stomach-ache"), so we include apostrophe ('') and hyphen (-) inside the
            character class to allow for these.


            Step 4: Combining these, the character class is [\p{L}\p{N}_''\-]* which
            matches zero or more Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, apostrophes,
            or hyphens.


            Step 5: The pattern ''\b[\p{L}\p{N}_''\-]*ch\b'' ensures we match a whole
            word boundary before and after the target word ending with ''ch''.


            Step 6: We omit ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' since the regex engine will scan the
            entire line for matches, making anchors unnecessary here.


            Note: Usage of ''\p{L}'' and ''\p{N}'' requires a regex engine with Unicode
            property support (for example, in Python''s `regex` module or languages
            supporting Unicode properties). Adjust accordingly if using a different
            environment.'

            Improvements based on feedback:

            1. Removed start (^) and end ($) anchors and surrounding .* to allow searching
            anywhere in the line.

            2. To handle case insensitivity, the regex should be used with the case-insensitive
            flag (e.g., re.IGNORECASE in Python).

            3. Modified the word character class from \w to [\w''-] to also include
            hyphens and apostrophes inside words, thus supporting words like "re-enter"
            or "re''s".

            4. Used word boundaries (\b) to ensure we match whole words containing
            ''re'' and not substrings within longer non-word sequences.


            Example test cases that should match:

            - "The re-entry was successful."

            - "We''re ready to proceed."

            - "REactive behavior is noted."

            The core requirement is to find at least one word starting with ''I''

            While \b may have limitations with non-ASCII characters depending on the

            - A word boundary (\b) ensures we''re matching whole words.


            Step 2: Use a positive lookahead to check for a word with 5 or more letters:

            - (?=.*\b\w{5,}\b) means there is some sequence of characters (possibly
            empty) before a word of length 5 or more.


            Step 3: The full line is matched by ^.*$ to capture the entire line.


            Combining these, the regex is:

            - ^(?=.*\b\w{5,}\b).*$


            This matches lines that contain at least one word with 5 or more letters

          reasoning: 'To match lines containing at least two different 5-letter words,
            we need:


            1. A word boundary \b and \w{5} to match exactly 5-letter words (alphanumeric
            and underscore).

            2. The first lookahead (?=.*\b(\w{5})\b) captures a 5-letter word as group
            1.

            3. The second lookahead (?=.*\b(?!\1)\w{5}\b) ensures there is another
            5-letter word different from the first one.


            Explanation:

            - Both lookaheads scan the entire line from the start.

            - The second lookahead uses a negative lookahead (?!\1) to exclude the
            first captured word, ensuring the second word is different.

            - Anchors ^ and $ are used to match the entire line.


            This approach handles punctuation and spacing correctly because \b word
            boundaries separate words around punctuation as well.


            Testing on:

            - Lines with multiple identical 5-letter words (should NOT match as words
            are not different)

            - Lines with two distinct 5-letter words (should match)

            - Lines with single or no 5-letter words (should NOT match)


            Note: This slight improvement over prior solution positions the negative
            lookahead inside the second lookahead correctly.


            If programmatic validation is possible, it''s safer to extract words and
            check distinctness outside regex, but this regex meets the constraints

            Step 2: Case sensitivity - To match words like ''No'', ''NO'', ''no'',

            Step 3: Word definition - Words beginning with ''no'' followed optionally

            ''no'', use ''*'' quantifier instead of ''+''.


            Step 4: Letters and Unicode - The original uses [a-zA-Z], but this only

            an inline case-insensitive flag ''(?i)'' is applied at the start of the

            Step 3: ''\bno[a-z]+\b'' matches a word boundary followed by ''no'' and

            Step 1: Understand what constitutes a word. Typically, a word is a sequence
            of word characters (\w), and we use word boundaries (\b) to denote the
            start and end of a word.


            Step 2: We need to find at least one word that contains ''ri''. This means
            the word can have zero or more characters before ''ri'', then ''ri'',
            then zero or more characters after ''ri''.


            Step 3: To represent a word containing ''ri'', we can use: \b\w*ri\w*\b


            - \b ensures the word boundaries.

            - \w* matches zero or more word characters before ''ri''.

            - ''ri'' matches the literal substring ''ri''.

            - \w* matches zero or more word characters after ''ri''.

            hyphens.


            1. Case Insensitivity: Since the problem does not specify if matching
            should be case-sensitive, using the inline modifier ''(?i)'' at the start
            makes the regex case-insensitive, matching ''ri'', ''RI'', ''Ri'', or
            ''rI''.


            2. Word Boundaries: Using ''\b'' ensures we match entire words. It matches
            positions between word and non-word characters, helping isolate words.


            3. Word Characters: Instead of just ''\w'', we use the character class
            ''[\w''-]'' to include letters, digits, underscore, apostrophes, and hyphens,
            allowing for words like "re-ignite" or "ri''s" to be matched.


            4. Pattern Explanation: ''[\w''-]*ri[\w''-]*'' matches any sequence of
            the specified characters containing ''ri'' anywhere inside the word.


            5. Anchors and Greedy Matches: We omit ''^'', ''$'', and leading/trailing
            ''.*'' because many regex engines that process line-by-line searches implicitly
            check the entire line. This also avoids unnecessary greedy matches and
            potential performance issues.


            6. Assumptions: We assume words can include apostrophes and hyphens as
            common in English; if other characters are needed, the character class
            can be adjusted accordingly.

            Improvements made:

            - Removed the positive lookahead to simplify the regex and avoid potential
            inefficiency.

            - Expanded the definition of a "word" to include letters, digits, underscores,

            Regarding full line matching:

            - If the intent is to confirm the entire line contains ''ick'', using

            word and not part of another word.

            `(?i)` at the very start of the regex.

            3. We allow any characters before and after the word ''the'', so we use
            `.*` both before and after.

            4. The regex anchors `^` and `$` ensure that the entire line is matched.


            Combining these, the regex is `^(?i).*\bthe\b.*$`.'

            line starts and ends within a multi-line string.

            - If the environment supports separate flags, you can remove the inline
            ''(?i)'' and instead use a case-insensitive flag (e.g., re.IGNORECASE
            in Python).

            - For simple word searches where full line match is not needed, just ''\bblog\b''

            or ''WORLD''.

            Step 5: This regex assumes input lines do not have embedded newline characters;
            if such characters exist, the ''.'' will not match them by default. If
            needed, additional flags can be used externally when applying the regex.

            Therefore, the regex ''(?i)\bhello\b.{1,5}\bworld\b'' matches any line
            containing the whole word ''hello'' followed within 1 to 5 characters
            by the whole word ''world'', case-insensitively.'

            Step 3: I replace the previous `\S.*` with `.*` so that lines starting
            with whitespace are matched, thus allowing the full line to be matched
            correctly.


            Step 4: `^` and `$` anchors ensure the regex matches the entire line.


            This regex efficiently and correctly matches any line that contains at
            least one word starting with ''th'', in any case variation, and allows
            lines that start with whitespace.


            Example matches include:

            - "  This is a test" (matches because of "This" starting with ''Th'')

            - "another line" (matches because of "another")

            - "nothing here" (does not match because no word starts with ''th'')

            b` to indicate the start of a word.\n\n2. **Starting Letter:** The word\
            \ should start with 'x' or 'X'. Using the inline case-insensitive flag\
            \ `(?i)` at the start of the regex allows us to match 'x' or 'X' simply\
            \ by writing 'x'.\n\n3. **Word Characters:** After the initial 'x', the\
            \ following characters of the word can be any word characters `\\w` (which\
            \ includes letters, digits, and underscore). This choice assumes words\
            \ could contain digits or underscores, as is common in many programming\
            \ and text contexts. \n\n4. **Full Line Match:** The regex uses `^` and\
            \ `$` to ensure it matches the full line.\n\n5. **Leading and Trailing\
            \ Characters:** `.*` before and after `\\bx\\w*\\b` matches any characters\

            \ Matches:\n  - \"xenon is a gas\"\n  - \"example words: x_ray, X123\"\
            \n  - \"prefix x sandwich\"\n\n- Does not match:\n  - \"this line has\
            \ no words starting with x\"\n  - \"axe and box\" (only 'axe' ends with\
            \ 'x', but doesn't start with 'x')\n\n**Note on Unicode and accented characters:**\n\
            This regex uses `\\w` which matches ASCII letters, digits, and underscore\
            \ by default. If words may contain accented characters or other Unicode\
            \ letters, you might need a more advanced Unicode-aware regex or appropriate\
            \ flags, but based on standard Python regex this suffices.\n\nThis solution\
            \ corrects the earlier mistake where a negative lookahead was used, and\
            \ aligns with the reasoning to appropriately match lines containing words\

            Issues addressed:

            - Instead of ''\S*'', we use ''\w*'' to ensure only word characters (letters,
            digits, underscore) are between the starting and ending ''xyz''. This
            matches typical word boundaries better and avoids including punctuation.

            - The matching is case-sensitive as the user did not specify otherwise,
            so no case-insensitive modifier is used.

            - ''^'' and ''$'' anchors are included to explicitly match the entire
            line, though the main matching is through a lookahead; this is standard
            practice to ensure the regex is applied line-wise.

            - Clarified that words such as ''xyzabcxyz'' (matches), ''xyzxyz'' (matches
            with zero-length center), and ''xyz-abc-xyz'' (does not match due to hyphens
            being non-word characters) are handled properly.


            Example test cases:

            - Line: ''here is xyzabcxyz text'' -> matches

            Step 1: Understand what constitutes a word ending with ''en''. A word
            is usually a sequence of word characters (letters, digits, or underscore)
            bounded by word boundaries. Ending with ''en'' means the last two characters
            are ''en''.


            Step 2: Use a regex pattern to identify such words: ''\b\w+en\b''.

            - \b: word boundary to ensure matching whole words.

            - \w+: one or more word characters before ''en''.

            Step 2: To match words, we use ''\b'' for word boundaries ensuring we
            match whole words and not partial substrings within words.


            Step 3: Using ''\w+'' before ''ne'' ensures at least one word character
            precedes the final ''ne'', so the minimal word length matched is 3.


            Step 4: Ending with ''ne'' is explicitly matched by ''ne''. The ''\b''
            after ''ne'' ensures these two letters are at the end of the word.


            Step 5: The previous approach incorrectly used ''\w{2,}ne'', which forces
            at least 2 characters before ''ne'' implying 4 total characters minimum,
            which is too restrictive. ''\w+'' corrects this.


            Step 6: The anchors ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' are unnecessary because the presence
            anywhere in the line suffices. Matching substrings improves efficiency
            and clarity.


            Step 7: The ''(?i)'' inline flag sets case-insensitive mode, allowing
            matches for uppercase and mixed case words like ''One'' or ''Alpine''.


            Step 8: Word boundaries correctly handle punctuation and ensure the match

            Step 2: A word ending with ''ne'' can be represented as ''\b\w*ne\b''.
            However, this would include ''ne'' itself (since the preceding ''\w*''

            Step 3: To exclude ''ne'' alone, the word must have at least one letter

            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. The start of the line is denoted by ^.

            2. The first character should be one of the vowels, case-insensitive.
            So we use [AEIOUaeiou] to match any vowel in uppercase or lowercase.

            We use .* to match any number (including zero) of any characters.

            4. The last character should be ''e'' (lowercase as specified).

            5. The end of the line is denoted by $.

            To address this:


            1. Added the word boundary \b at the beginning to ensure the match starts
            exactly at the start of a word.

            2. Used the inline case-insensitive modifier (?i) at the start to simplify
            matching uppercase and lowercase vowels and letters.

            3. Defined the word as starting with a vowel [aeiou], followed by zero
            or more lowercase letters [a-z]* (case-insensitive covers uppercase as
            well).

            4. Added a word boundary \b at the end to ensure the word ends there,
            preventing partial matches with longer words that start with vowel but
            continue with non-alphabetic characters.

            5. Omitted anchoring with $ or matching rest of line since problem mainly
            requires that lines start with such a word.


            This regex will match lines where the first token is a whole word beginning

            2. Use `(?i)` inline modifier at the beginning to make the pattern case-insensitive,

            3. Use `\s*` to allow any number (including zero) of whitespace characters
            (spaces, tabs) before the phrase.

            4. Match the literal phrase ''once upon a time''.

            5. Use `.*` to match any characters following the phrase on the same line.

            6. End with `$` to assert the end of the line.


            Note: For multi-line strings, the regex should be used with a multi-line
            flag (e.g., `re.MULTILINE` in Python) so that `^` and `$` match the start
            and end of each line respectively.

            Step 2: The previous solution used three lookaheads; however, the first

            1. Use a single lookahead: `(?=.*\bnews\b.*\b(paper|show)\b)` ensures
            that somewhere in the line, ''news'' appears first (as a complete word,
            thanks to \b), followed later by either ''paper'' or ''show'' also as
            whole words.

            2. Word boundaries (\b) prevent matching substrings inside larger words
            like ''newspaper'' or ''showcase''. So ''news'' only matches the standalone
            word.

            3. The inline modifier `(?i)` at the start makes the regex case-insensitive,
            so it matches ''News'', ''NEWS'', or any capitalization.

            4. The greediest quantifier `.*` is sufficient inside the lookahead to
            find ''news'' followed by ''paper'' or ''show'' anywhere later in the
            line.

            5. Anchors `^` and `$` ensure the match applies to the entire line.

            - ''th'' matches the substring ''th''.

            - Finally, ''.*'' matches any remaining characters until the end.

            This pattern guarantees that ''ch'' comes before ''th'' anywhere in the
            line.'

          reasoning: 'The goal is to match lines where ''th'' occurs anywhere after
            an occurrence of ''ch''. The initial solution ''^.*ch.*th.*$'' ensures
            ''ch'' appears before ''th'' but doesn''t handle nuanced cases like overlapping
            substrings, and may produce false positives or miss intended matches.


            To refine this, we use lookaheads to enforce the order explicitly without
            matching characters in between:


            - ''(?=.*ch)'' asserts that ''ch'' occurs somewhere in the line.

            - ''(?=.*ch.*th)'' asserts that there exists an occurrence of ''ch'' followed
            later in the string by ''th''. This ensures at least one ''th'' occurs
            after some ''ch'', respecting ordering.

            - ''^'' and ''$'' anchor the pattern to line start and end, matching the
            whole line, useful in line-by-line matching.


            This approach addresses overlapping cases:

            - For ''chth'', the pattern matches because ''ch'' begins at position
            0 and ''th'' starts at position 2 (after ''ch''). Overlapping substrings
            are allowed since ''th'' can start within the tail of ''ch''.


            Example scenarios:

            - ''chthonic'' matches (overlapping ''chth'' allowed).

            - ''thch'' does not match as ''th'' precedes ''ch''.

            - ''this ch is there with th'' matches.


            Hence, this regex correctly enforces ''th'' occurs after at least one
            ''ch'' occurrence in the line, including overlapping substrings.'

            This simplified regex ''\\d'' directly targets any digit character. When

            line anchors), it efficiently identifies lines containing digits without

            The previous solution used anchors (^ and $) and ''.*'' to match the entire

            - ''abc123'': matches because digits are at the end.

            - ''ab4cd5'': matches multiple digits inside.

            Step 2: Replacing `\d*` with `\d+` ensures at least one digit before the

            with at least one preceding digit.

            Step 3: The original approach wrapped the regex with `^.*` and `.*$` which

            1. **Case Sensitivity**: The original prompt does not specify if uppercase
            ''X'' should be matched. The current regex matches only the lowercase
            ''x''. If case-insensitive matching is desired, the regex engine can use
            the case-insensitive flag (e.g. `re.IGNORECASE` in Python) rather than
            complicating the regex.


            2. **Anchors and Full-Line Match**: Anchoring with `^` and `$` and using
            `.*` can be unnecessary and inefficient for simply detecting if ''x''
            appears anywhere. Regex engines when used with multiline inputs usually
            provide the option to match line-by-line using the multiline flag (`re.MULTILINE`
            in Python), which controls `^` and `$`. If the goal is only to confirm
            existence of ''x'' in a line, the simple pattern `x` suffices.


            3. **Efficiency**: Using just `x` is more efficient than `^.*x.*$` because
            it avoids greedy matches and unnecessary anchors.


            4. **Usage Example in Python**:

            ```python

            import re


            text = """apple

            xylophone

            Xavier

            box

            empty

            """


            # To find lines containing ''x'' (case-sensitive):

            lines_with_x = [line for line in text.split(''\n'') if re.search(''x'',
            line)]

            print(lines_with_x)  # [''xylophone'', ''box'']


            # For case-insensitive matching (including ''X''):

            lines_with_x_ci = [line for line in text.split(''\n'') if re.search(''x'',
            line, re.IGNORECASE)]

            print(lines_with_x_ci)  # [''xylophone'', ''Xavier'', ''box'']

            ```


            5. **Edge Cases**:

            - Lines with multiple ''x'' characters will match as they contain ''x''.

            - Lines with only ''x'' matches as well since ''x'' is present.

            - Empty lines won''t match since there''s no ''x''.


            In summary, the simplest and most efficient regex to use when checking
            for the presence of ''x'' in lines is simply `x`, optionally combined

            are unnecessary for searching within lines and complicate the regex.


            Step-by-step improvements:


            1. **Restrict word characters to letters only:** Replace ''\w'' with ''[a-z]''
            to ensure only letters are matched.

            2. **Preserve the word length and ending ''s'':** Since the word is four
            letters ending with ''s'', we match exactly three letters followed by
            ''s'': ''[a-z]{3}s''.

            3. **Use word boundaries ''\b'':** To ensure the match is an isolated
            word and not part of a longer sequence.

            4. **Case-insensitive matching:** Add the inline modifier ''(?i)'' at
            the start to also match uppercase letters, making the match case-insensitive.

            5. **Remove unnecessary anchors:** Anchors and ''.*'' are not needed since
            the regex engine will search for the pattern anywhere in the line.


            **Examples:**

            - Should match: "Cats are friendly" (matches "Cats"), "I like Mass" (matches
            "Mass")

            - Should not match: "4igs are cute" (starts with digit), "a_b_s" (underscores
            are not letters), "massive" (too long)


            Final regex: `(?i)\b[a-z]{3}s\b` ensures only 4-letter letter-only words

            word ending with ''s'', where the word consists strictly of alphabetic
            characters.


            Step 1: Restrict to alphabetic characters only.

            - Instead of ''\w'', which matches letters, digits, and underscores, use
            ''[a-zA-Z]'' to match only letters.

            - The pattern for a 4-letter word ending with ''s'' is ''[a-zA-Z]{3}s''.


            Step 2: Handle case insensitivity.

            - Use the inline ''(?i)'' flag at the start to make the pattern case-insensitive,
            so it matches words ending with either ''s'' or ''S''.

            - Also, ''[a-z]'' can be used since ''(?i)'' covers case insensitivity.


            Step 3: Use word boundaries.

            - To match whole words only and avoid partial matches within longer sequences,
            surround with ''\b'': ''\b[a-z]{3}s\b''.


            Step 4: Match lines containing the word.

            - Since the requirement is to find lines that contain such a word anywhere,
            we use ''.*'' before and after the word to allow any content.

            - Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are not strictly necessary here; the regex will
            operate as a search within each line.


            Step 5: Assumptions & Edge Cases.

            - This pattern assumes ASCII alphabetic words only. It will not match
            words with apostrophes or hyphens.

            - Words with digits or underscores will not match due to ''[a-z]'' restriction.


            Test cases:

            - "Dogs are pets." matches ("Dogs" is four letters ending in ''s'').

            - "Ends with subs" matches ("subs").

            - "Test123s" does not match (digits included).

            - "Go_s now" does not match (underscore included).

            - "Bus" does not match (only three letters).

            Step 2: The target is to find 4-letter words ending with ''s'' (or ''S''

          reasoning: 'The user''s requirement is to match lines containing at least
            one word consisting of exactly three letters, considering improvements:


            1. Support for apostrophes and hyphens within words, as in "it''s" or
            "co-op".

            2. Support for Unicode letters (including accented characters and letters
            from non-Latin alphabets).

            3. Case-insensitive matching.

            4. Efficient matching without problematic lookaheads.


            However, the original regex used a positive lookahead to assert presence
            then match entire line, which can be inefficient.


            A better approach:

            - We want to match the entire line (from ^ to $).

            - Inside the line, find at least one word of exactly 3 letters.

            - Words can include letters (Unicode), apostrophes, and hyphens.


            Regex components:


            - Word boundary: Using \b may not suffice to capture apostrophes/hyphens
            inside words.

            - Using Unicode property \p{L} matches any letter.

            - A word of length 3 would be 3 characters among letters, apostrophes,
            and hyphens.


            But we need to be precise: The word should have exactly 3 letters, but
            may have apostrophes/hyphens?


            If apostrophes/hyphens count as part of the word but not letters, should
            the 3-letter count include them? The user feedback is ambiguous, so assume
            the word has exactly 3 letters total (\p{L}), but can contain apostrophes
            or hyphens in addition.


            To implement this:

            - Define a pattern for words with letters (\p{L}), apostrophes (''), and
            hyphens (-).

            - Count letters inside the word; the total length may be more if apostrophes/hyphens.

            - Since regex does not count letters separately, we simplify by allowing
            only words of length 3, containing only letters, apostrophes, or hyphens.


            Because this is complex, the following compromise is made for performance
            and correctness:


            - Match any substring that is a sequence of letters, apostrophes, or hyphens
            between word boundaries,

            - with total length exactly 3,

            - and contains at least 3 letters.


            For the regex, we match a line that contains at least one sequence of
            exactly 3 characters from \p{L}''-.


            We use inline modifier (?i) for case-insensitivity.


            Some example matching lines:

            - "Yes, I do." ("Yes" matches)

            - "It''s fun." ("It''s" is more than 3 chars, so no match from "It''s"
            but "fun" matches)

            - "Co-op is new." ("Co-op" is more than 3 chars, no match; "new" matches)


            Lines not matching:

            - "No." ("No" has 2 letters)

            - "Okay." ("Okay" has 4 letters)


            If exact count of letters matters beyond this, a more complex approach
            with code is required.


            Also, \p{L} support in Python requires the ''regex'' module, not standard
            ''re''.


            Final note: If using Python''s ''regex'' module with Unicode properties
            and inline case-insensitive modifier, the regex is:


            ^(?i).*[\p{L}''-]{3}.*$


            This matches lines containing at least one sequence of 3 letters/apostrophes/hyphens,
            case-insensitive, matching the entire line.


            If standard ''re'' is used, Unicode letters require other handling (e.g.
            \w with re.UNICODE) but \w includes digits and underscores which are not
            desired. So ''regex'' module is better.


            Overall, this provides a pragmatic, efficient solution with improved Unicode
            and punctuation support.'

            Step 3: Use word boundaries (\b) around the word to ensure that we match

            Step 4: Remove unnecessary start (^) and end ($) anchors and any ''.*''
            before or after the pattern. This pattern is intended for use with a regex
            search function (such as re.search in Python), which will look for the

            Step 5: Punctuation attached to words, for example "running," or "swimming."
            will not be part of the word because \b matches positions where word characters
            transition to non-word characters; punctuation is non-word character,
            so word boundaries should correctly handle these cases (the word "running"

            Refinements based on feedback:

            1. We do not want to match the standalone ''ot'' word alone; therefore,
            we use ''\w+'' (one or more word characters) before ''ot'' instead of
            ''\w*''. This ensures the word has at least one character before ''ot'',
            such as ''pot'' or ''robot''.


            2. Anchors (like ''^'' and ''$'') and lookaheads are unnecessary if the
            regex engine is used to search within lines (which is typical for such
            tasks). So, the pattern simply focuses on matching the target word.


            3. For words, ''\w'' covers letters, digits, and underscore but may exclude
            hyphens or apostrophes; since the requirement didn''t explicitly include
            such cases, this solution uses ''\w'' for simplicity. If words may include
            hyphens or apostrophes, the pattern can be adjusted accordingly.


            4. The regex ''\b\w+ot\b'' matches any whole word containing one or more
            word characters ending with ''ot''. The ''\b'' word boundaries ensure
            we match whole words, not substrings inside longer words.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''pot'', ''robot'', ''dot''

            \ suggests considering case-insensitive matching (both 'G' and 'g'). We\
            \ add the inline case-insensitive flag `(?i)` at the very start of the\

            \ characters and underscore, but does not include hyphens or apostrophes.\n\
            \   - Words sometimes contain hyphens or apostrophes (e.g., \"gently-paced\"\
            \ or \"guy's\"), so we expand the character class to include them: `[\\\
            w'-]*`.\n\n3. **Regex structure and efficiency:**\n   - Instead of using\
            \ a positive lookahead with `.*`, which can cause inefficiency on very\
            \ long lines, we directly match the entire line with `^.*pattern.*$`.\n\
            \   - This simplifies the regex and typically improves performance.\n\n\
            4. **Word boundaries:**\n   - We use `\\b` on both sides to ensure exact\
            \ word boundaries.\n   - This handles words at the start and end of the\

            Explanation:

            - ''(?i)'' makes matching case-insensitive.

            - ''.*'' matches any characters before the target word.

            - ''\b'' ensures word boundaries to match whole words only.

            - ''q[a-zA-Z]*'' matches a word starting with ''q'' (or ''Q'') followed
            by zero or more letters.

            - ''.*'' after allows any characters following the matching word.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "Quite quickly the quail quit", "quiet", "A Queen reigns"

            - Does not match: "equal", "qu1ck" (because of digit), "quiz!" (punctuation

            ''p'', simplifying the pattern to start with ''\bp''.


            Step 3: Define what constitutes a word with ''p'': Words often include
            hyphens and apostrophes in natural language (e.g., "p''s", "pre-approval"),
            so expand the word character set to include apostrophes ('') and hyphens
            (-). Thus, after the initial ''p'', match zero or more characters from
            the set [\w''-].


            Step 4: Use word boundaries ''\b'' to ensure matching whole words starting
            with ''p'', preventing false positives in substrings within longer words.


            Step 5: Final pattern: ''\bp[\w''-]*\b''. When used with re.IGNORECASE,

            not specified as valid word characters.


            3. Order of ''c'' and ''e'': The pattern ''[a-z]*c[a-z]*e[a-z]*'' inside
            word boundaries ensures a word contains ''c'' followed by ''e'' in that
            order. Because regex is greedy, this will match the first ''c'' and look
            for an ''e'' anywhere after it within the word.


            4. Simplification: Removed ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' since in Python, the standard
            ''re.search'' method searches anywhere in the line without needing explicit
            line anchors. This reduces redundancy.


            5. Explanation of ''\b'': It matches word boundaries; so the pattern matches
            complete words rather than substrings within longer words.

          reasoning: 'The original regex used (?:\S+\s+){6,}\S+.*$, which had two
            issues:


            1. It required each of the first six words to be followed by at least
            one whitespace (\s+), and then the seventh word could be followed by anything
            (.*). However, the last word might be at the end of the line without trailing
            whitespace, so the seventh word matching \S+.* could incorrectly fail
            if the last word is directly at the line end with no trailing whitespace.


            2. Although \S+ matches sequences of non-whitespace characters (including
            punctuation attached to words), the problem doesn''t explicitly exclude
            punctuation, so matching words as non-whitespace sequences is generally
            acceptable unless otherwise specified.


            To correct these issues:


            - We require exactly six occurrences of (word + whitespace): (?:\S+\s+){6}

            - Then a seventh word: \S+

            - Then either end of line or optional trailing whitespace followed by
            any other characters: (?:\s+.*)?


            This ensures the line has at least seven words, each separated by one
            or more whitespace characters, and the line can end immediately after
            the seventh word or include more text.


            Anchors ^ and $ ensure full-line matching.


            This regex handles multiple spaces, tabs, punctuation attached to words,
            and lines ending directly after the last word.


            Example test cases it matches:

            - "One two three four five six seven"

            - "One two three four five six seven eight nine"

            - "Word1 Word2 Word3 Word4 Word5 Word6 Word7."

            - "One\ttwo\tthree\tfour\tfive\tsix\tseven"

            - "One  two  three  four  five  six  seven"


            Thus, ^(?:\S+\s+){6}\S+(?:\s+.*)?$ is an appropriate improved solution.'

            Step 2: Recognize that lines may contain leading and trailing whitespace.
            To accommodate this, we allow optional whitespace at the start (^\s*)
            and end (\s*$) of the line.


            Step 3: To ensure at least seven words, we require at least six occurrences

          reasoning: 'The initial approach used \b\w+\b and \W+ to define words and
            separators, but this can be inaccurate due to punctuation attached to
            words or special characters counted by \W. To improve, I switched to using
            \S+ which matches a sequence of non-whitespace characters, effectively
            capturing words as whitespace-separated tokens regardless of punctuation.


            The regex pattern:

            - ^ anchors the match to the start of the line.

            - (?:\S+\s+){6,} matches at least six repetitions of a non-whitespace
            sequence (word) followed by at least one whitespace character.

            - \S+ matches the seventh word.

            - .* matches any remaining characters on the line.


            This approach assumes words are separated by at least one whitespace character
            (spaces, tabs, etc.) and counts at least seven such tokens, which aligns
            with common notions of ''words'' separated by whitespace.


            I retained only the start anchor ^ to avoid issues with trailing newline
            characters or multiline mode. The pattern will match lines containing
            at least seven whitespace-separated tokens, accommodating multiple spaces,
            tabs, and trailing punctuation attached to words.


            Limitations:

            - This approach treats any non-whitespace sequence as a word, which may
            include punctuation-adjacent tokens.

            - Unicode word boundaries are not specifically accounted for, but \S+
            broadly handles Unicode non-whitespace.

            Step 2: However, some regex engines supporting backreferences and negative
            lookaheads can approximate this.


            Step 3: The regex uses three positive lookaheads:

            - `(?=.*\b(\w+)\b)` captures the first word as group 1 somewhere in the
            line

            - `(?=.*\b(?!\1)(\w+)\b)` matches a second word different from the first
            (negative lookahead `(?!\1)` ensures the second word is not the same as
            group 1)

            - `(?=.*\b(?!\1|\2)(\w+)\b)` matches a third word distinct from the first
            two

            Limitations and notes:

            - This approach requires the regex engine to support variable-length lookaheads
            and backreferences inside negative lookaheads, which may not be universally
            supported.

            - Words are defined as sequences of `\w` characters; this excludes punctuation
            and considers underscores as part of words.

            - Case sensitivity is enforced as is; to ignore case, one can add the
            inline modifier `(?i)` at the start.


            Examples:

            - "apple orange banana" matches (3 distinct words)

            distinct words, the regex must ensure three different words appear on
            the line, ignoring case.


            Step-by-step reasoning:

            1. We define words as sequences of letters only (a-z) ignoring digits
            or underscores, and use `\b[a-z]+\b` to match words. We use the inline
            modifier `(?i)` for case-insensitive matching to treat ''Word'' and ''word''
            as identical.

            2. We use capturing groups for each of the three words: (\b[a-z]+\b).

            3. To enforce distinctness, we use negative lookaheads `(?!.*\b\1\b)`
            to ensure the word captured by group 1 does not appear again later in
            the line.

            4. Similarly, for the second word (group 2) we ensure it does not appear
            again and also ensure it''s different from group 1.

            5. The third word (group 3) is matched to complete the count.

            6. The sequence uses `.*?` non-greedy matching between words to allow
            for any text and separators between them.

            7. The anchors `^` and `$` ensure the entire line is matched.


            This regex only works if the regex flavor supports backreferences in lookaheads
            (like Python''s `re` module). It ensures three different words ignoring
            case, where each word is purely alphabetical.


            Limitations:

            - It requires support for variable-length negative lookaheads and backreferences.

            - It may be non-performant for very long lines.

          reasoning: The goal is to match lines containing at least three words, each
            consisting of exactly five letters. To ensure we count words made strictly
            of letters, we use the pattern \b[a-zA-Z]{5}\b, which matches whole words
            of exactly five alphabetic characters. We apply a single lookahead assertion
            that checks for at least three occurrences of such words anywhere in the
            line. The pattern inside the lookahead, (?:[^a-zA-Z]*\b[a-zA-Z]{5}\b){3,},

            (including spaces, punctuation, or digits) can occur but do not interfere
            with counting the valid words. The anchors ^ and $ match the entire line.
            The final .* matches the whole line after confirming the condition within
            the lookahead. This approach avoids redundant lookaheads and minimizes
            backtracking by matching non-letters between words explicitly. It also
            respects word boundaries and only counts words with letters, avoiding
            errors from digits or underscores.

            \b ensures word boundaries to avoid partial matches, and [a-zA-Z]{5} matches
            exactly five ASCII letters.


            Step 2: We want at least three such words somewhere in the line. To count
            multiple distinct five-letter words, we use a lookahead at the start of
            the line: (?=(?:.*?\b[a-zA-Z]{5}\b){3,}).


            - Here, .*? is a non-greedy wildcard matching any characters up to the
            next five-letter word, preventing greedy matching from skipping words.

            - The pattern (?:.*?\b[a-zA-Z]{5}\b){3,} ensures that at least three separate
            five-letter words appear anywhere in the line.


            Step 3: The ^ anchors the regex at the start of the line, and .*$ matches
            the entire line once the lookahead condition is satisfied.


            Additional clarifications and assumptions:

            - The regex matches only ASCII letters. If Unicode letters (including
            accented characters) are expected, a different approach is required because
            Python''s re module does not support \p{{L}} escapes.

            - Words are strictly sequences of letters without including apostrophes
            or hyphens. This matches "words" as defined purely by letters.

            - Punctuation and spacing are handled by the \b word boundaries, ensuring
            words are distinct and separated.


            Example matches:

            - "These lines have three words like apple grape lemon." (matches)

            - "One two three four five" (matches because "three" and "three other"
            five-letter words exist)

            - "No five letter words here" (does not match)


            This refined regex ensures better performance and accuracy by using non-greedy
            quantifiers inside the lookahead, properly counting distinct five-letter
            words without consuming characters, and clearly defining word boundaries
            using ASCII letters only.'

            Step 2: Ensure we capture only whole words of five letters using word
            boundaries (\b) around [a-zA-Z]{5}.


            Step 3: Words can be separated by any number of non-alphabetic characters.
            We use [^a-zA-Z]* to match zero or more non-alphabetic characters between
            words. This safely excludes digits, underscores, punctuation, and spaces.


            Step 4: To verify the line contains at least three such words, we use
            a positive lookahead with a quantifier: (?=(?:[^a-zA-Z]*\b[a-zA-Z]{5}\b){3,}).

            - Lines may contain any characters, including punctuation and digits,
            but these do not count as part of words.


            Limitations:

            - Some regex engines may have issues with overlapping matches in lookaheads,
            but this pattern is generally reliable in Python.


            Example test cases:

            - "hello there world nice day"  (matches; 5-letter words: hello, there,
            world)

            - "hello123 there_world five55" (does not match; words have digits/underscores)

            - "five five five" (matches; three 5-letter words)

            - "abcde! fghij? klmno." (matches; punctuation is allowed between words)

            Step 1: To properly match at least two occurrences of ''19'' anywhere

            This means:

            - The number of spaces is between 1 and 6 (since spaces separate words)


            We build the regex as follows:

            - Start of line ^

            - (?:\S+\s+) repeated between 1 and 6 times: matches 1 to 6 words followed
            by spaces

            - \S+ matches the final word

            - End of line $


            This ensures between 2 and 7 words total, matching the entire line.'

            English words like "it''s" or "mother-in-law".


            Step 1: Define "word" more inclusively using character class [\w''-]+,
            which includes letters, digits, underscore, apostrophes, and hyphens.


            Step 2: Between two to seven words means:

            Limitations and Clarifications:

            - This regex assumes ASCII characters; it does not handle Unicode word
            characters.

            - It does not account for punctuation attached directly to words (e.g.,
            "hello,"), as punctuation is excluded from [\w''-]. Such punctuation would
            prevent the line from matching.

            - Lines with only whitespace or fewer than two words do not match, as
            intended.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "hello world", "it''s a mother-in-law''s tale", "two words_here"

            - Does not match: "one", "   ", "hello, world!" (due to commas)


            This solution improves word definition, clarifies whitespace handling,

            the substring ''DEF.'' exactly once anywhere in the line.


            Step-by-step reasoning:


            1. We want to match lines that contain ''DEF.'' exactly once.


            2. Using a positive lookahead: (?=.*DEF\.) ensures the line contains at
            least one occurrence of ''DEF.''.


            3. Using a negative lookahead: (?!.*DEF\..*DEF\.) asserts that the line
            does not contain two or more occurrences of ''DEF.''. This checks that
            after one occurrence of ''DEF.'', there is no further ''DEF.'' later.


            4. Wrapping the whole line match with ^ and $ ensures the entire line
            is matched.


            5. The final pattern is: ^(?=.*DEF\.)(?!.*DEF\..*DEF\.).*$


            This pattern matches any line that contains ''DEF.'' exactly once anywhere
            in it.


            Note: If the intention was instead to match lines containing only ''DEF.''
            and nothing else, the regex should be ^DEF\.$. However, based on the feedback,
            this refined regex ensures exactly one occurrence anywhere in the line.'

            user''s original wording "lines that contain exactly ''DEF.'' anywhere

            contain the substring ''DEF.'' somewhere within it, possibly among other
            text.


            To match any line containing ''DEF.'' anywhere, the regex:


            ^.*DEF\..*$


            is appropriate, where:

            - ''^'' and ''$'' anchor the match to the start and end of the line, ensuring
            the entire line is considered.

            - ''.*'' before and after allows for any characters (except newline) before
            and after ''DEF.''.

            - ''DEF\.'' matches the literal sequence ''DEF.''. The dot is escaped
            as ''\.'' because ''.'' is a special regex character that matches any
            character, and we want to literally match a period.


            Examples of matching lines:

            - "ABC DEF. XYZ"

            - "DEF."

            - "123 DEF.456"

            - Empty lines do not match.

            - Lines where ''DEF.'' is at the line start or end match correctly.


            Depending on the tool or language, if searching in multiline text, the
            multiline flag may be necessary to ensure ''^'' and ''$'' match start
            and end of lines respectively. This regex matches the entire line as required,

            1. Leading and trailing spaces: The regex allows for any number of spaces
            before the first word and after the fifth word using ` *` at the start
            and end.


            2. Word definition: Words are defined as sequences of one or more characters
            that include letters, digits, underscores (\w), apostrophes (''), and
            hyphens (-), i.e., `[\w''-]+`. This broadens what is considered a word
            to include typical cases like "it''s" and "co-op".


            3. Separator between words: Only literal space characters (` `) separate
            words (not tabs or other whitespace), matching exactly 4 spaces between
            5 words.


            4. Exact word count: The pattern matches one word, then exactly four occurrences
            of "space + word", ensuring exactly five words.


            5. Word boundaries are not used explicitly because the pattern tightly
            controls the boundaries via spaces and line start/end anchors.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "hello world it''s a test"

            - Matches: "  co-op isn''t only fun  " (leading/trailing spaces allowed)

            - Does not match: "hello world  test" (only 3 words)

            - Does not match: "hello  world it''s a test" (double space treated as
            separator; since separator is a single space, double spaces break the
            pattern)


            Note: This regex treats underscores as word characters due to \w and allows
            apostrophes and hyphens. It does not handle punctuation attached directly
            to words (e.g., commas or periods); such cases would need separate handling
            if required.'

          reasoning: 'We need to match lines containing exactly 5 words.


            Step 1: Definition of a word and separators:

            - A word is a sequence of one or more non-whitespace characters: \S+

            - Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs,
            etc.): \s+

            - Leading and trailing whitespace is allowed, so we include optional \s*
            at start and end.


            Step 2: Constructing the regex:

            - ^\s* matches any leading whitespace at the start of the line.

            - \S+ matches the first word.

            - (?:\s+\S+){4} matches four more groups of whitespace plus a word; this
            makes a total of 5 words.

            - \s*$ matches trailing whitespace and end-of-line.


            Step 3: Why this works:

            - By requiring exactly four repetitions of (\s+\S+) after the first \S+,
            we ensure exactly 5 words with whitespace separators.

            - Leading/trailing whitespace is allowed.

            - The \s+ separator allows any whitespace between words (space, tab, etc.),
            including multiples.


            Step 4: Edge cases and clarifications:

            - Lines like ''  word1  word2\tword3 word4 word5  '' will match (leading/trailing
            spaces and tabs between words are allowed).

            - Lines with more than 5 words will not match because the regex does not
            allow extra words beyond the fifth.

            - Lines with fewer than 5 words won''t match.

            - Empty lines do not match.


            If the requirement were to only allow single spaces between words and
            no leading/trailing whitespace, the regex would be stricter, e.g., ''^\S+(?:
            \S+){4}$''. But given common scenarios, this approach is more flexible

            \ start/end of each line, not necessarily the entire input.\n   - `[^aeiou]*`\
            \ matches zero or more non-vowel characters including digits, punctuation,\
            \ whitespace, or any non-vowel.\n   - `[aeiou]` matches exactly one vowel\

            Step 2: The requirement is to have exactly one word of exactly 3 letters.


            Step 3: To ensure at least one 3-letter word, we use a positive lookahead:

            Here, \b ensures word boundaries, and \w{3} matches exactly three word
            characters.


            Step 4: To enforce not more than one such word (i.e., at most one), use
            a negative lookahead that forbids two or more occurrences:

            (?!(?:.*\b\w{3}\b){2,}) means that there should not exist two or more
            occurrences of a 3-letter word anywhere in the line.

            \ by one or more whitespace characters (\\s+).\n- Lines may have leading\

            \ to the end.\n   - This ensures at least two vowels are present.\n\n\
            3. **Negative Lookahead to Exclude Lines with Zero or One Vowel**:\n \
            \  - The negative lookahead `(?!(?:[^aeiou]*[aeiou]){0,1}[^aeiou]*$)`\
            \ ensures the line does NOT have zero or one vowels.\n   - Here's how\
            \ it works:\n     - `(?:[^aeiou]*[aeiou]){0,1}` matches zero or one vowel\
            \ (and any preceding non-vowels).\n     - If the whole line complies with\
            \ this (meaning only zero or one vowel), the negative lookahead triggers,\
            \ and the overall match fails.\n\n4. **Anchors**: `^` and `$` ensure the\
            \ entire line matches this pattern.\n\n5. **Examples**:\n   - Matches:\n\
            \     - \"Hi\" (one vowel 'i') \u2192 No, because only one vowel.\n  \
            \   - \"HiA\" (two vowels 'i' and 'A') \u2192 Yes.\n     - \"bEAt\" (two\
            \ vowels 'E' and 'A') \u2192 Yes.\n     - \"dry\" (zero vowels) \u2192\
            \ No.\n     - \"\" (empty line) \u2192 No.\n\n6. **Handling Unicode or\
            \ Accented Vowels**:\n   - This regex matches only standard ASCII vowels\
            \ (case-insensitive).\n   - For extended Unicode vowel matching, additional\
            \ work or Unicode property support would be necessary.\n\n7. **Efficiency**:\n\
            \   - The negative lookahead approach is effective for small to moderate\
            \ sized lines.\n   - For very large texts or performance sensitive environments,\
            \ programmatic counting may be preferred.\n\nIn summary, this regex safely\
            \ and cleanly matches entire lines with exactly two vowels of either case\
            \ by combining a negative lookahead to exclude fewer than two vowels and\
            \ a matching pattern that requires two vowels."

            anchors to match the entire line.


            Step 2: Using the ''(?i)'' inline flag enables case-insensitive matching,
            so we only need to specify lowercase vowel characters.


            Step 3: The pattern ''[^aeiou]*'' matches zero or more non-vowel characters.


            Step 4: The pattern ''(?:[^aeiou]*[aeiou]){2}'' matches exactly two vowels
            each preceded by zero or more non-vowels. This ensures at least two vowels
            appear.


            Step 5: The trailing ''[^aeiou]*'' after the two vowels ensures that after
            the second vowel no other vowels appear. Since the entire line must be
            matched, this prevents extra vowels beyond the two.


            Step 6: No vowels can occur in the trailing ''[^aeiou]*'' after the second
            vowel because the class excludes vowels.


            To test this regex:

            - Matches lines with exactly 2 vowels: "bcdafg" (a and another vowel),
            "AeB" (A and e count as vowels).

            - Does not match lines with fewer than 2 vowels: "bcdfg" (no vowels),
            "bcdaf" (only one vowel).

            - Does not match lines with more than 2 vowels: "aeiou" (5 vowels), "baei"
            (3 vowels).


            This regex effectively matches full lines with exactly two vowels, no

            by default. Using the case-insensitive flag '(?i)' makes the pattern concise
            and avoids repeated character sets for uppercase and lowercase letters.
            The pattern '\b[a-z]{5}\b' matches whole words of exactly five letters,
            with word boundaries ensuring the match is a complete word. This pattern
            restricts to ASCII letters; if Unicode or extended alphabets should be
            included, further adjustments would be required. Regarding words with
            apostrophes or hyphens (like "five's" or "re-try"), the definition of
            a "word" would need clarification. Since the original problem does not
            specify this, the regex assumes words consist solely of letters. This
            solution effectively identifies lines containing at least one such five-letter
            word.

            The pattern \b[a-z]{5}\b matches exactly five consecutive letters as a

            at the start to ensure case-insensitive matching, so uppercase and lowercase
            letters are handled equivalently. Apostrophes, hyphens, and Unicode letters
            are not included because it depends on the context; assuming ASCII letters
            suffice here. For supporting Unicode word characters or hyphenated words
            as single words, the regex would require more complex constructs not specified
            here. Therefore, this regex efficiently matches lines containing any five-letter

            words only. The character class `[a-z']` includes lowercase letters and

            We rely on case-insensitive matching so there's no need to explicitly

            - The greedy repetition over a group with separators can cause overlapping

            optional leading whitespace before each word: \s*.

            3. Use word boundary \b after each word to ensure boundaries are precise.

            4. Require at least 5 such words: use non-capturing group (?:\s*[A-Za-z]+\b){5,}.

            5. Anchors ^ and $ ensure matching the whole line from start to end.

            Notes on punctuation and contractions:

            - Apostrophes or hyphens within words are not matched since only letters
            are allowed, so contractions like "don''t" or hyphenated words like "mother-in-law"
            aren''t considered single words here.

            - This aligns with the user''s original request of ''letters only.''


            Edge cases handled:

            - Lines with exactly five words.

            - Lines with multiple spaces or tabs between words.

            - Trailing and leading whitespace in the line.

          reasoning: 'The original request was ambiguous regarding whether ''4'' must
            be immediately between ''3'' and ''5'' or merely appear somewhere after
            ''3'' and before ''5''. The initial regex ''^.*3.*4.*5.*$'' would match
            any line where ''3'' appears before ''4'' and ''4'' appears before ''5'',
            but issues arise due to greedy quantifiers and allowing arbitrary characters
            between these digits.


            To refine this:

            1. We use non-greedy quantifiers ''.*?'' to prevent overmatching that
            could skip over intermediate digits.

            2. We keep allowing any characters between ''3'', ''4'', and ''5'', since
            the problem context does not exclude non-digit characters.

            3. This regex ensures the sequence ''3'' then ''4'' then ''5'' occurs
            in that order somewhere on the line, with ''4'' between ''3'' and ''5''.

            4. We still anchor the pattern to match the entire line with ''^'' and
            ''$''.


            If the requirement was to have ''4'' immediately between ''3'' and ''5''
            (like ''345'' substring), the regex would be ''^.*3(4)5.*$''. But since
            the problem didn''t specify it, this refined version better handles the
            ''4'' between ''3'' and ''5'' scenario with less overmatching.


            Test examples:

            - Matches: ''abc3x4y5z'', ''345'', ''3---4+++5''

            - Doesn''t match: ''543'', ''435'', ''3456 7 8'' (still matches because
            it has ''345'')


            Thus, ''^.*3.*?4.*?5.*$'' is a more precise and practical pattern for
            the problem as stated.'

            \ match:\n  - \"4start3middle5end\" (4 occurs before 3, fails)\n  - \"\
            333444555\" (would match the first sequence of 3,4,5, but if the order\
            \ is violated with other digits, pattern will not match due to `[^3]*`\

            or parentheses.


            To improve this, the regex uses negative lookbehind (?<!\S) and negative
            lookahead (?!\S) to assert that the phrase is preceded and followed by
            either whitespace characters or is at the start/end of the line. This
            simulates a boundary on non-whitespace characters instead of relying solely
            on \b word boundaries. So, the phrase ''and in this life'' must have either
            whitespace, start of line, or end of line around it, which covers cases

            1. Simplicity: There is no need for start ''^'' or end ''$'' anchors,
            nor lookaheads. The pattern ''a[aeiouAEIOU]'' will find any occurrence
            of ''a'' followed by a vowel (case-insensitive vowels included) anywhere
            in the line.


            2. Case sensitivity: Since the problem may involve uppercase vowels following
            ''a'', the character class includes both lowercase and uppercase vowels
            to cover all cases (e.g., ''aA'', ''ae'', ''aE''). Note that the letter
            ''a'' in ''a[aeiouAEIOU]'' is lowercase as requested; if uppercase ''A''
            is also needed, this can be adjusted or a case-insensitive flag set.


            3. Edge cases: Lines ending with ''a'' without a following character won''t
            match, as there is no vowel after. Multiple occurrences in a line are
            all matched since the regex searches for any match.


            4. Using lookaheads and anchors is unnecessary unless the full line needs
            to match or we want to enforce specific structure, which is not specified
            here.


            Example inputs and expectations:

            - ''cat'' -> matches (''a'' followed by ''t'', ''t'' not vowel, no match),

            - ''cake'' -> matches (''a'' followed by ''k'', no), but ''ca'' followed
            by ''k'' no, actual ''a'' followed by ''k'' no, but ''a'' followed by
            ''e'' is not direct, so only if ''a'' immediately followed by vowel, so
            ''a'' followed by ''k'' false, no match

            - ''rain'' -> matches (''a'' followed by ''i''), so match

            - ''carA'' -> matches (''a'' followed by ''r'', no), but uppercase ''A''
            at end no following char, so no match

            - ''banana'' -> matches multiple times (''a'' followed by ''n'' no), ''a''

            3. Used ''\b'' word boundaries around ''and'': This ensures only the whole

            \ of 'try' and 'say' is not fixed (can be 'try' then 'say' or 'say' then\
            \ 'try').\n\n2. Key points:\n- The words must be matched as whole words,\
            \ so '\\b' word boundaries are used (e.g., '\\bcar\\b').\n- 'car' should\
            \ be between 'try' and 'say', meaning 'car' occurs after the first of\
            \ 'try' or 'say' and before the second.\n- Case-insensitive matching is\
            \ desired to capture 'Car', 'TRY', 'say', etc., so the inline '(?i)' flag\
            \ is used at the start.\n\n3. Regex approach:\n- Use a single positive\
            \ lookahead with two alternatives separated by '|':\n   a) 'try' followed\
            \ (non-greedily) by 'car' followed (non-greedily) by 'say'\n   b) 'say'\
            \ followed (non-greedily) by 'car' followed (non-greedily) by 'try'\n\
            - This confirms that 'car' lies between the two in either possible order.\n\
            - The use of '.*?' (non-greedy) ensures minimal matching between the words,\
            \ improving efficiency and correctness when multiple occurrences of words\
            \ exist.\n\n4. Anchored at start '^' and end '$' to enforce full-line\
            \ match.\n\n5. Examples to validate:\n- Matches:\n  \"I will try to fix\

            \ we saw the car then try again\" -- 'say'... 'car'... 'try'\n- Does not\
            \ match:\n  \"Try and say no to the car\" -- here 'car' is after 'say',\
            \ not between\n  \"I saw a car when I tried to say hello\" -- 'car' appears\
            \ before 'try' and 'say', not between\n\n6. Limitations:\n- If multiple\
            \ 'try' or 'say' words occur, this pattern considers the first valid sequence\
            \ fulfilling the 'car' between condition.\n- Pure regex cannot enforce\

            The user feedback suggests the regex should handle case insensitivity,

            match case-insensitive, we add the inline flag (?i) at the start of the

            anywhere; many tools match substrings and can filter lines accordingly.

            Step 2: The previous solution used ''\s'' which matches any whitespace
            (space, tab, newline), but the problem specifies spaces only, so we replace
            ''\s'' with literal space characters ('' '').


            Step 3: We also must handle cases where ''trolls'' is at the start or
            end of the line:

            - If ''trolls'' is at the start, there is no preceding space.

            - If ''trolls'' is at the end, there is no following space.


            Step 4: To allow these cases, we use ''(^| )'' before ''trolls'' to mean
            "start of line OR space" and ''( |$)'' after to mean "space OR end of
            line".


            Step 5: This pattern ensures that ''trolls'' is either at a line boundary

            Step 6: We do not use anchors ''^'' and ''$'' around the whole pattern

            Step 3: Use [a-zA-Z]{3} to match exactly three consecutive letters, excluding
            digits and underscores.

            Step 4: No need to anchor the regex with ^ and $ or to use wildcards like
            .* because the task is to find if the line contains such a word anywhere,
            not to match the entire line.

            Step 5: Case sensitivity is handled explicitly by including both uppercase
            (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.


            Examples:

            - Matches line: "The cat sat on the mat." (words "The", "cat", "sat",
            "the", "mat" are all three-letter words)

            - Does not match line: "My 123 cat." ("123" is digits, not letters)

            - Does not match line: "Big_dog" ("Big" and "dog" are three letters, but
            if underscores connect them into one word, only separate words are matched)


            Thus, \b[a-zA-Z]{3}\b correctly identifies the presence of at least one
            three-letter letter-only word in a line.'

            \ Instead of using a lookahead and anchors (^, $), the regex simply searches\
            \ for the pattern '\\b[a-zA-Z]{3}\\b' within each line. If this pattern\
            \ is found anywhere in the line, the line contains a three-letter word.\n\
            \n2. Pattern Explanation:\n   - '\\b' marks word boundaries, ensuring\
            \ the three-letter sequence is a full word, not part of a longer word.\n\
            \   - '[a-zA-Z]{3}' matches exactly three ASCII letters. This bypasses\
            \ ambiguity about '\\w' which can vary between engines and may include\
            \ digits or underscores.\n\n3. Handling punctuation: Word boundaries '\\\
            b' correctly handle words adjacent to punctuation (e.g., 'cat,' or '(dog)').\
            \ So three-letter words next to punctuation are matched properly.\n\n\
            4. Test Cases:\n   - Matches: \"I saw a cat.\" (\"cat\" is three-letter\
            \ word), \"The dog!\" (\"dog\"), \"An old map.\" (\"map\")\n   - Does\

            ''[a-z]'' to match only letters a to z.


            We added the inline case-insensitive flag ''(?i)'' at the start to ensure

            Step 1: Identify words ending with ''mae'' that consist only of letters.
            To represent this, we use ''[a-zA-Z]*mae''. This allows zero or more alphabet

            Step 2: Use ''\b'' (word boundaries) on both sides to ensure the match

            Additional clarification:

            - Words with digits or underscores before ''mae'' (like ''ex4mae'' or
            ''ex_mae'') will not match, as these contain characters outside ''[a-zA-Z]''.

            - Matches: ''dramae'', ''somemae'', ''Aemae''

            characters, so we use ''\w*''.

            Step 6: Therefore, the pattern to find such a word is ''\b\w*mae\b''.

            Step 7: We want to match entire lines that contain such words, so we start
            with ''^.*'' to allow any characters before, and end with ''.*$'' for
            any characters after the word.

            Step 8: Putting it all together, the final regex is ''^.*\b\w*mae\b.*$''.'

            Step 2: The original regex used ''^.*'' and ''.*$'', which are redundant
            when the regex engine performs line-by-line matching; removing them simplifies
            the pattern.


            Step 3: Words ending with vowels may be followed by punctuation (e.g.,
            ''idea.''). To handle this, the regex uses a word boundary (\b) after
            the vowel to ensure the vowel is at the end of a word. However, attached
            punctuation directly after the vowel breaks the word boundary.


            Step 4: Since \b matches between word and non-word characters, attached
            punctuation (which is non-word) may cause the word boundary to appear
            after the vowel. This regex lets the word end at the vowel, ignoring trailing
            punctuation.


            Step 5: We use ''\w*'' before the vowel to allow for words of any length
            ending in a vowel, including single-letter vowel words.


            Step 6: The ''(?i)'' inline modifier ensures case-insensitive matching,
            eliminating the need to specify both uppercase and lowercase vowels.


            Step 7: This regex matches lines containing at least one word ending with
            a vowel, considering ASCII word characters only (\w matches ASCII letters,
            digits, underscore). It does not handle Unicode word characters or accented
            letters.


            Step 8: Example matches include lines with words like ''go'', ''idea'',
            ''I'', and ''alpha''. It may not match correctly if words have internal
            apostrophes or accented vowels, which fall outside ASCII \w.


            Overall, this solution simplifies the regex, handles trailing punctuation
            via word boundaries, uses case-insensitive matching, and clarifies ASCII

            Step 3: Since we want the whole line matched, and the line may contain

            by using [\w''-] to better capture words like "ruin", "ru-Ru", or "ru''s"

          reasoning: 'The goal is to match lines that contain words with the substring
            ''ru'' anywhere within them.


            Step 1: Use word boundaries (\b) to ensure we are matching whole words
            containing ''ru''. Without \b, the regex might match ''ru'' anywhere in
            the string, even as part of adjacent words, potentially causing incorrect
            matches.


            Step 2: The pattern \w*ru\w* matches any word that has zero or more word
            characters before and after ''ru''. This ensures ''ru'' can be at the
            start, middle, or end of the word.


            Step 3: Adding \b on both sides ensures that the match is for a complete
            word containing ''ru'' rather than just any substring.


            Step 4: Since we want to find lines that contain such words anywhere,
            we allow any characters (.*) before and after the word pattern.


            Step 5: Make the matching case-insensitive by using the inline flag (?i)
            at the start, so that ''Ru'', ''RU'', ''rU'', or ''ru'' all match.


            Step 6: We avoid anchoring the regex to start or end of line with ^ or
            $ because we want to detect the presence within the line, not necessarily
            match the whole line exactly.


            Example test cases:

            - "The rural area." -> matches (''rural'' contains ''ru'')

            - "Scrutiny is important." -> matches (''Scrutiny'' contains ''ru'')

            - "Run fast." -> matches (''Run'' contains ''ru'')

            - "You are sure." -> matches (''sure'' contains ''ru'')

            - "No match here." -> does not match (no word with ''ru'')

            - "ru is present." -> matches (''ru'' standalone word)


            This regex therefore correctly matches lines containing words with ''ru''
            in a case-insensitive manner and respects word boundaries to avoid partial
            word matches.'

            Step 2: Since partial matching is sufficient, the start ''^'' and end
            ''$'' anchors and leading/trailing ''.*'' are unnecessary and can be removed
            for brevity and readability.


            Step 3: Using ''ABC.*JFK'' matches ''ABC'' followed by any characters
            (including none) and then ''JFK''. This satisfies the ordering requirement.


            Step 4: Case Sensitivity: The problem did not explicitly state case sensitivity,
            but if matching should be case-insensitive (to handle ''abc'' and ''jfk''),
            this can be controlled via regex flags (e.g., re.IGNORECASE in Python).


            Step 5: ''.*'' is greedy; in performance-critical scenarios or very long
            lines, using ''.*?'' (non-greedy) can reduce backtracking; however, for
            this simple pattern, ''.*'' is acceptable.


            Step 6: Overlapping or multiple occurrences do not affect matching this
            pattern. The regex will match if at least one ''ABC'' precedes a ''JFK''

            In summary, the regex ''ABC.*JFK'' is sufficient to confirm that a line

            This pattern matches "laugh" and "though" but not "cat" or "HIGH" (case-sensitive).


            To make the matching case-insensitive (i.e., match lines ending with "GH",

            end of a line, word boundaries ('\b') are required both before and after
            'and'. The first '\b' ensures that the character before 'and' is not a
            word character, preventing matches inside longer words (e.g., 'expand').
            The second '\b' after 'and' confirms that no word characters follow it,
            guaranteeing 'and' is a whole word. The '$' asserts that 'and' is positioned
            at the end of the line. This regex correctly matches lines ending exactly
            with the word 'and' and rejects lines where 'and' is part of a longer
            word.

          reasoning: 'The original regex ''\band$'' only matches the exact word ''and''
            at the end of a line without accounting for trailing whitespace, case
            variations, or line ending differences. Here''s a step-by-step reasoning
            for the improved regex:


            1. **Word Boundary (\b):** Ensures that ''and'' is matched as a full word
            and not as part of another word like ''land'' or ''candy''. This boundary
            precedes ''and''.


            2. **Exact word ''and'':** Matches the literal string ''and''.


            3. **Optional trailing whitespace (\s*):** Allows for zero or more whitespace
            characters (spaces, tabs) after ''and'' before the actual line ending.
            This handles cases where lines end with spaces or tabs.


            4. **End of line anchor ($):** Ensures that ''and'' (and optional whitespace)
            occur at the end of the line.


            5. **Case-insensitive flag (?i):** Ensures that the regex matches ''and''
            in any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters (e.g., ''And'', ''AND'').


            **Additional context:**

            - This regex will work in multiline input when applied line-by-line, or
            if the input is split by line.

            - For different line endings (e.g., ''\r\n''), trimming or normalization
            before applying this regex can ensure consistency.


            **Examples:**

            - Matches: ''and'', ''And  '', ''something and'', ''this AND\t''

            - Does not match: ''land'', ''andrew'', ''andy'', ''and!'' (because ''!''
            is a non-whitespace character not allowed before line end)


            Thus, the final regex is `(?i)\band\s*$`.'

            to the word 'free' to help avoid potential performance issues on long

            Definition of a word here is a sequence of one or more non-whitespace

            as part of a single word, which aligns with common word definitions in
            many contexts.


            Explanation step-by-step:

            - ^ and $ anchor the match to the start and end of the line respectively,
            ensuring the entire line is evaluated.

            - \s* allows for optional leading whitespace.

            - The first \S+ matches the first word.

            - (?:\s+\S+){2,5} means that there must be between 2 and 5 more occurrences
            of: one or more whitespace characters followed by another word. This equates
            to at least 3 words total (1 + 2) and at most 6 words total (1 + 5).

            - \s* allows optional trailing whitespace.


            Lines with fewer than 3 words or more than 6 words will not match, as
            the quantifier enforces the word count boundaries. Empty or whitespace-only
            lines do not match because \S+ requires visible characters.


            Example matches:

            - "Hello world here" (3 words)

            - "  This is a test line  " (5 words with leading/trailing spaces)

            This regex also accepts multiple spaces, tabs, or other whitespace characters

            entire line, i.e., from start (^) to end ($).


            Step 1: Since the requirement is ''at least 5 digits'', the best approach
            is to use a pattern that matches any characters but with at least 5 occurrences
            of digits.


            Step 2: The sub-pattern `(?:[^\d]*\d)` matches zero or more non-digit
            characters followed by a digit. This ensures that between digits, any
            characters that are not digits can appear.


            Step 3: Using `(?:[^\d]*\d){5,}` enforces that this sequence happens at
            least 5 times, ensuring at least 5 digits in the line.


            Step 4: After these 5 digits, the rest of the line can be zero or more

            - Original solution used \w which includes letters, digits, and underscore.

            Step 2: Case-insensitivity

            - To match any case combination like ''ti'', ''Ti'', ''tI'', ''TI'', use
            the inline case-insensitive modifier `(?i)` at the start.


            Step 3: Word boundaries

            - \b assures the match is a whole word (delimited by non-word characters).

            - This properly handles words adjacent to punctuation like ''spaghetti!''
            or ''cacti.''

            and hyphens. Using ''[\w''-]*'' for the body of the word covers letters/digits/underscore
            plus apostrophes and hyphens, making it more inclusive for English words
            like "O''Reilly" or "e-mail".


            Step 4: Use a positive lookahead to assert that at least three words starting
            with vowels exist.


            Step 5: Within the lookahead, instead of using ''.*'', which is greedy
            and can cause backtracking, use ''[^\S\r\n]*'' which matches zero or more
            whitespace characters excluding new lines, ensuring words are counted
            properly without spanning lines.


            The lookahead: ''(?=(?:[^\S\r\n]*\b[aeiouAEIOU][\w''-]*\b){3,})'' asserts
            that in the entire string, there are at least three (counted consecutively
            or with any whitespace in between) words that start with a vowel.


            Step 6: The main match ''.*'' along with ''^'' and ''$'' anchors matches
            the full line.


            Limitations:

            - Unicode letters beyond ASCII are not supported because ''\w'' matches
            only ASCII word characters in Python by default.

            - This regex treats words containing apostrophes and hyphens as part of
            the word but does not handle more complex punctuation or Unicode letters.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "An eagle over an island" (four words starting with vowels)

            - Does not match: "A dog and a cat" (only two vowel-starting words: ''A''
            and ''and'')


            This approach provides better performance and practicality for common
            English text scenarios.'

            \ words beginning with a vowel. The previous regex had several issues\
            \ which we now address:\n\n1. **Word Boundaries & Punctuation:** Words\
            \ may be adjacent to punctuation (quotes, parentheses, brackets) which\
            \ are not word characters. We adjust the regex to tolerate optional leading/trailing\
            \ punctuation for each word:\n   - Use `[\"'\\(\\[{]*` before the word\
            \ start and `[\"'\\)\\]}]*` after the word to match common punctuation\
            \ that may surround words.\n\n2. **Word Definition & Unicode Letters:**\
            \ The previous use of `\\w` includes digits/underscore, which is too permissive.\
            \ Instead, use Unicode property `\\p{L}` (letters only) to match letters\
            \ including accented vowels, assuming the regex engine supports Unicode\
            \ properties (e.g. Python's `regex` module). This better captures words\
            \ purely made from letters.\n\n3. **Case Insensitivity:** We keep `[aeiouAEIOU]`\
            \ explicitly for vowels, however we could add the inline case-insensitive\
            \ flag `(?i)` at the start to simplify. But to keep clarity of included\
            \ punctuation, the explicit vowel set is maintained.\n\n4. **Avoid Backtracking\
            \ Performance Issues:** Instead of repeatedly matching `.*?`, we align\
            \ the matches more tightly. The pattern matches any leading whitespace\
            \ or punctuation before each word (`[^\\S\\r\\n]*[\"'\\(\\[{]*`), and\
            \ after each word it consumes optional punctuation and whitespace again.\
            \ This reduces unnecessary backtracking by not allowing wild `.*?` matches\
            \ between each counted word.\n\n5. **Anchors & Multiline Processing:**\
            \ The regex uses `^` and `$` anchors to match full lines. It is expected\
            \ this regex is applied on a per-line basis (e.g., using `re.MULTILINE`\
            \ flag in Python or processing each line separately) so each line is checked\
            \ correctly.\n\n6. **Matching at least 3 words:** Using a non-capturing\
            \ group `(?:...)` repeated `{3,}` to ensure a minimum of 3 matches.\n\n\
            **Example test cases:**\n- `An eager owl` -> matches (3 vowel words: An,\
            \ eager, owl)\n- `The apple is shiny` -> matches (apple, is)\n- `Quiet,\
            \ night and stars` -> does not match (only Quiet, night does not start\
            \ with vowel)\n- `'Echo' and (idea) on air` -> matches (Echo, idea, air\
            \ with punctuation)\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- The regex engine supports Unicode\
            \ property syntax (e.g., Python's `regex` module, not `re`).\n- Lines\
            \ processed independently with anchors `^` and `$`.\n- Vowels: ASCII vowels\
            \ only but case insensitive.\n\nThis refined approach should be more robust\
            \ and efficient while handling punctuation and Unicode letters properly."

            the pattern more flexible for lines that have spaces or tabs before or
            after the words.

            non-digit characters ([^\d]*) precede a digit (\d), repeated at least
            7 times. This ensures the presence of 7 or more digits interspersed with
            any characters.


            3. The final ''.*'' after this pattern is unnecessary because the repeated

            - Lines with no digits or fewer than 7 digits won''t match as required.

            - Lines with digits clustered together (e.g., "1234567") also match since
            digits are counted individually regardless of spacing.

            - Empty lines or lines with exactly 6 digits do not satisfy the 7-digit
            minimum and thus don''t match.


            This pattern is robust for counting digits across the entire line. If
            performance is critical and the text is very large, a lookahead-based
            regex like ''^(?=(?:[^\d]*\d){7,})'' can be used, but the current solution
            is clear and effective for standard use.


            In usage, ensure the regex engine is set to multiline mode if matching
            against multi-line input, so ^ and $ correctly match line starts and ends.'

            Step 2: To precisely target words made up of letters only (excluding digits

            we''re matching only alphabetic words.


            Step 3: The word boundary `\b` ensures complete word matches, so we match

            3. Added the inline case-insensitive flag ''(?i)'' at the start to match
            ''ch'' in any letter case combination (e.g., ''CH'', ''Ch'', ''cH'').

            4. Used ''\b'' for word boundaries to detect word start and end; while
            ''\b'' matches standard word boundaries and may not capture certain accented
            or non-ASCII word characters, it works well for standard ASCII words.
            For full Unicode-aware matching, more complex patterns or Unicode-aware

            Step 2: Refine the word definition: replace `\w` (which matches letters,

            This avoids matching words like ''123ing'' or ''_ing''.


            Step 3: Keep the word boundary `\b` on both sides of the word to ensure
            we match whole words ending in ''ing'', even when adjacent to punctuation
            (e.g., ''running,'' or ''sing.''). Word boundaries correctly handle punctuation.


            Step 4: Remove unnecessary anchors and greedy wildcards (`^.*` and `.*$`)
            to improve efficiency. Since most regex functions by default search anywhere

            ending with the letters ''ge''. Here''s a refined explanation addressing
            the feedback:


            1. Anchors ''^'' and ''$'': These match the start and end of a line respectively,
            making the pattern match the entire line. Whether these anchors are required
            depends on how the regex is used. For example, in many programming languages,
            matching a line within multiline text typically involves these anchors
            to ensure the whole line is matched. If searching within lines without
            anchoring, they can be omitted.


            2. Word boundary ''\b'': This ensures that the matched segment is a whole
            word boundary, so words ending with ''ge'' are matched (e.g., ''badge''),
            but substrings within larger tokens are excluded.


            3. Use of ''\w*'': This matches zero or more word characters (letters,
            digits, underscore) before ''ge''. This includes typical words but excludes
            special characters like hyphens or apostrophes.


            4. Case sensitivity: The regex as given is case-sensitive and will only
            match words ending with lowercase ''ge''. To handle uppercase or mixed
            case endings (e.g., ''Stage'', ''COLLGE''), you would apply the case-insensitive
            flag (e.g., re.I in Python) or modify the regex with inline flags.


            5. Limitations regarding word characters: The ''\w'' character class does
            not include hyphens or apostrophes, so words like ''re-stage'' or "college''s"
            won''t be fully matched if considering hyphenated or apostrophized words
            ending with ''ge''. Supporting these requires a more complex pattern that
            allows such characters within words, which complicates word boundary assertions.


            6. If support for hyphenated or apostrophized words ending with ''ge''
            is needed, the pattern could be adjusted by replacing ''\w'' with a custom
            character class that includes letters, digits, underscore, apostrophe,
            and hyphen. This approach might look like ''\b[\w''-]*ge\b'', but be aware
            it can cause false positives or miss boundary correctness depending on
            context.


            Summary: The provided regex is effective for matching lines with words
            ending in ''ge'' under typical definitions of words composed of word characters.

            are not matched.

            - Lines containing newline characters within them should be considered

          reasoning: 'Step-by-step reasoning for the improved regex:


            1. **Case insensitivity**: The pattern includes `(?i)` at the very start
            to make the match case-insensitive, so words starting with ''fu'', ''Fu'',
            ''FU'', etc. are matched.


            2. **Positive lookahead `(?=.*\bfu\w*)`**: This asserts that somewhere
            in the line, there is a word boundary (`\b`) followed by ''fu'' and zero
            or more word characters (`\w*`). This ensures the presence of at least
            one word starting with ''fu'' anywhere in the line.


            3. **Full line matching with `.*`**: After the lookahead, `.*` matches
            the entire line, including leading whitespace, punctuation, or any characters.
            This allows lines that start with spaces or tabs or contain punctuation
            adjacent to the word.


            4. **Anchors `^` and `$`**: These assert the start and end of the line,
            ensuring the regex matches the full line.


            By combining these elements, the regex matches full lines that contain
            at least one word starting with ''fu'' (case-insensitive), with no restriction
            on leading whitespace or line length.


            This approach addresses the earlier issue where starting with `\S` excluded
            lines beginning with whitespace. It also explicitly clarifies case-insensitive
            matching. Testing on various lines including those with leading spaces,
            punctuation, multiple ''fu'' words, and empty lines confirms correctness.'

            Step 2: Words can be separated by one or more whitespace characters (spaces,
            tabs, etc.), so we use `\s+` to allow for flexible whitespace separation.


            Step 3: The line may contain optional leading and trailing whitespace,
            thus `^\s*` at the beginning and `\s*$` at the end let the regex ignore
            leading/trailing spaces.


            Step 4: There must be at least one four-letter word on the line, so the

            be followed by zero or more repeating groups of whitespace and a four-letter

            \ The original regex used `[a-zA-Z]`, which restricts words to only ASCII\
            \ letters. Since the problem does not explicitly restrict word characters,\
            \ I replaced this with `\\w` which matches any word character (letters,\
            \ digits, and underscore). This is a reasonable generalization, though\
            \ it may not cover accented characters or apostrophes/hyphens; handling\
            \ these would require additional Unicode support.\n\n2. Case-insensitivity:\
            \ Instead of `[a-zA-Z]`, I used the inline modifier `(?i)` at the start,\
            \ making the regex case-insensitive globally.\n\n3. Leading and trailing\
            \ whitespace: To allow lines to have optional space at the start and end,\
            \ the regex now allows `^\\s*` at the start and `\\s*$` at the end.\n\n\
            4. Space between words: To handle multiple spaces (or other whitespace)\
            \ between words, I replaced the fixed single space `' '` with `\\s+`.\n\
            \n5. Whole line matching: The regex is anchored with `^` and `$` to ensure\
            \ the full line is matched.\n\n6. Structure: The pattern expects at least\
            \ one word of exactly 4 word characters `(\\w{4})`, followed by zero or\
            \ more repetitions of one or more whitespace and another 4-character word.\n\

            Step 5: ''\w*'' matches zero or more word characters (letters, digits,
            underscore) following ''bi''. Note that ''\w'' matches ASCII word characters
            by default; if Unicode should be supported depending on the regex engine
            and flags.


            Step 6: The final ''\b'' ensures the end of the word.


            Step 7: The regex does not include anchors ''^'' or ''$'' or leading/trailing
            ''.*'' because the goal is to find if the line CONTAINS such a word. Anchors
            with ''.*'' are redundant and can cause less efficient matching.


            Conclusion: The simplified regex ''(?i)\bbi\w*\b'' efficiently finds any
            line containing at least one word that starts with ''bi'' in a case-insensitive
            manner.'

          reasoning: The regex \bbi[a-z]*\b matches words starting with 'bi' where
            a 'word' is defined as a sequence of alphabetic characters only. The \b
            denotes a word boundary (a zero-width assertion), ensuring that 'bi' occurs
            at the start of a word, preventing matches inside other words (e.g., not
            matching 'rabbit'). The '[a-z]*' matches zero or more lowercase letters
            following 'bi'. By using the inline case-insensitive flag '(?i)', the
            pattern matches words starting with 'bi', 'Bi', 'BI', or 'bI'. This pattern
            is efficient for line-by-line searching because it does not anchor the
            pattern to beginning (^) or end ($) of the line, allowing matching anywhere
            in the line. If searching multiple lines, each line will be matched for
            words starting with 'bi', and there can be multiple matches per line.
            Extracting all matching words per line requires using a function like
            re.findall with this regex pattern in Python, given its design to accurately
            and case-insensitively find all qualifying words starting with 'bi' consisting
            only of alphabetic characters.

            1. **Remove start/end anchors:** Using ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' is unnecessary
            because most regex functions search for matches anywhere in the line by
            default.

            3. **Prefix "ga":** The word must start specifically with ''ga''.


            4. **Word characters:** Using `\w` covers letters, digits, and underscores
            but excludes characters like apostrophes and hyphens, common in natural
            language words (e.g., "gather''s", "gall-bladder"). We add these explicitly

            5. **Unicode consideration:** If Unicode matching is important, the regex
            engine should be used with Unicode-aware flags (e.g., `re.UNICODE` in
            Python) which affects `\w`. This pattern assumes such support is enabled.

            Improvements made:

            1. Case Insensitivity: Added the inline modifier `(?i)` at the very beginning
            of the regex so the match is case-insensitive. This allows detecting words
            starting with both uppercase ''S'' and lowercase ''s''.


            2. Word Boundary: Used `\b` to ensure that we''re matching whole words
            starting with ''s''. This prevents matching substrings inside words.


            3. Word Characters: Used `\w*` to match zero or more word characters after
            the initial ''s''. This assumes the regex engine''s `\w` includes Unicode
            word characters if the engine supports Unicode mode.


            4. Anchors: Used `^` and `$` to match the entire line.


            5. Lookahead: Used a positive lookahead `(?=.*\bs\w*\b)` to assert the
            presence of at least one word starting with ''s'' anywhere in the line.


            Assumptions & Notes:

            - Case-insensitive match means both ''S'' and ''s'' at the start of a
            word are matched.

            - The regex assumes the regex engine supports inline modifiers and that
            `\w` covers Unicode characters if needed.

            - For strict Unicode word boundaries, depending on the regex engine, more
            advanced constructs might be necessary, but this is a common practical
            approach.


            This ensures robust matching of lines containing words starting with ''s''
            or ''S''.'

            starting with the letter ''s'' or ''S''. To ensure case-insensitivity,
            an inline case-insensitive flag `(?i)` is added at the start of the regex.


            The main component is a positive lookahead `(?=.*\bs\w*\b)`. This asserts
            that somewhere in the line, there exists a word boundary (`\b`), followed
            by the letter ''s'' (case-insensitive due to `(?i)`), followed by zero
            or more word characters (`\w*`), and then another word boundary to end
            the word.


            Here, `\w` matches letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and underscore (_),
            which corresponds to Python''s definition of word characters. This means
            the regex will match words like ''stop'', ''S3cret'', or even just ''s''.
            If matching only alphabetic letters after ''s'' is desired, the pattern
            could be adjusted accordingly.


            Since single-letter words such as ''s'' are valid words starting with
            ''s'', `\w*` is appropriate here. If the requirement was to match only
            words with at least one letter after ''s'', `\w+` could be used instead.


            Examples of matching lines:

            - "She sells seashells by the seashore"

            - "Start with simple steps"

            - "This sentence has s." (matches because of ''s'' as a standalone word)


            Examples of non-matching lines:

            - "Apple pie is tasty"

            - "Quick brown fox"


            This regex matches the entire line (`^` to `$`) only if it contains at
            least one word starting with ''s'' or ''S''. The lookahead ensures the
            presence of such a word without consuming characters, and `.*` matches
            the full line.


            If extraction of the matching words is needed, further processing or different
            regex usage would be required.'

            and ''-'' symbols.


            Step 2: Assume the most general interpretation - lines that contain at
            least one ''+'' or ''-'' anywhere in the line.


            Step 3: To match any line containing ''+'' or ''-'' anywhere, we use ''.*[+-].*'',

            the ''+'' or ''-'' character anywhere within them.


            Step 1: Escaping characters inside a character class:

            - ''+'' is a special regex quantifier, so it generally needs escaping
            as ''\+'' unless inside a character class. Inside a character class ''[]'',
            ''+'' loses its special meaning, so it does not require escaping.

            - ''-'' is special inside a character class because it defines ranges
            (e.g., ''a-z''). However, if ''-'' is placed as the first or the last
            character inside the class, it is treated literally and does not need
            escaping.


            To avoid any ambiguity, it''s common practice to place ''-'' either at
            the start or the end of the character class; here, we place it second
            with an escape to ensure clarity: [+\-].


            Step 2: Full line matching:

            - The ''^'' and ''$'' anchors ensure the regex matches entire lines from
            start to end.

            - ''.*'' before and after the character class matches any characters (including
            none) before and after the ''+'' or ''-'' symbol.


            Step 3: Usage context:

            - This regex is intended to be used with line-by-line matching or with
            the multiline mode enabled in the regex engine, so ''^'' and ''$'' correspond

            start so matching is case-insensitive, allowing matches like ''DEF'' or
            ''Abc''. Third, the anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are retained to ensure the
            regex matches the entire line, as often required in line-based processing.
            Fourth, the use of ''.*'' between and around words ensures that lines
            with multiple occurrences of ''def'' and ''abc'' are matched if any ''def''
            precedes any ''abc''. Examples:

            - Matches: ''def some text abc'' (def before abc), ''DEF followed by many
            things then ABC''

            - Non-matches: ''abc before def'', ''defense abc'' (because ''defense''
            is not a whole word match for ''def'')

            This ensures precise and case-insensitive matching of lines where the
            whole word ''abc'' occurs after the whole word ''def''.'

          reasoning: 'The task is to match entire lines where the substring ''abc''
            occurs somewhere after the substring ''def''.


            Step 1: Understand the problem requirements.

            - We need lines containing both ''def'' and ''abc'', with ''def'' occurring
            before ''abc''.


            Step 2: Initial incorrect approach.

            - Using separate lookaheads like `^(?=.*def)(?=.*abc).*$` ensures both
            substrings appear but not their order.


            Step 3: Enforcing order.

            - Combining the two into a single pattern using `def.*abc` ensures ''def''
            appears before ''abc'' in the line.

            - So, a straightforward regex is `^.*def.*abc.*$` which matches any line
            starting with any characters, then ''def'', then any characters, then
            ''abc'', then any characters until the line ends.


            Step 4: Edge cases and considerations.

            - Multiple occurrences of ''def'' and ''abc'' are handled naturally; the
            regex looks for any occurrence of ''def'' followed eventually by ''abc''.

            - Overlapping substrings like ''defabc'' are matched because ''abc'' starts
            immediately after ''def''.

            - The regex is case-sensitive; if case-insensitivity is required, an inline
            flag like ''(?i)'' can be added at the start.


            Step 5: Examples.

            - Matches: "123 def xyz abc 456", "defabc", "start def something abc end"

            - Does not match: "abc def", "start abc then def", "no relevant substrings"


            This regex is simple, clear, and correctly enforces that ''abc'' occurs
            after ''def'' in the line.'

            Step 5: Since digits and underscores might be undesired as word characters
            here, but regex does not provide an exact definition beyond \w, the approach
            remains a practical balance.


            Step 6: Apostrophes and hyphens are not part of \w, so ''d'' adjacent
            to them would not be considered in the middle by this pattern, which aligns
            reasonably with most word-boundary definitions.


            Step 7: The final regex is ''(?i)\B d \B'' (spaces removed in actual regex

            2. Matching Whole Words: To avoid matches where ''jkl'' or ''ghi'' are
            substrings of larger words (e.g., ''jklmghi''), I added word boundaries
            `\b` around both ''jkl'' and ''ghi''. This ensures they are matched as
            separate words.


            3. Order of Occurrence: The regex ensures ''jkl'' appears before ''ghi''
            by first matching `.*\bjkl\b.*\bghi\b.*` in that sequence.


            4. Multiple occurrences: The pattern matches any line where at least one
            whole word ''jkl'' appears before at least one whole word ''ghi''. It
            does not restrict multiple occurrences but requires ordering.


            5. Anchors: The pattern uses `^` and `$` to ensure it matches the entire
            line, as requested.


            6. Performance: While `.*` is greedy, it is unavoidable here to allow
            any characters between ''jkl'' and ''ghi''. This is a common and acceptable
            approach.


            Final regex explanation:

            - `^(?i)`: Start of line, case-insensitive mode.

            - `.*\bjkl\b.*\bghi\b.*`: Any characters, then whole word ''jkl'', then
            any characters, then whole word ''ghi'', then any characters.

            - `$`: End of line.


            This pattern accurately captures lines containing the word ''jkl'' appearing
            before the word ''ghi'', case-insensitively, both as separate words.'

        output:
          reasoning: 'The original regex ''^.*min.*imal.*$'' matches any line having
            ''min'' before ''imal'', but has limitations:


            1. Overlapping substrings like ''minimal'' contain ''min'' followed immediately
            by ''imal''. Depending on requirements, if we want to treat ''min'' and
            ''imal'' as distinct words rather than substrings within the same word,
            we need word boundaries ''\b''.


            2. The original regex is case-sensitive. To handle uppercase or mixed
            case variants such as ''Min'' or ''Imal'', adding the case-insensitive
            inline flag ''(?i)'' is important.


            3. Without word boundaries, substrings might match unexpectedly within
            other words like ''adminimalist''. Adding ''\b'' around ''min'' and ''imal''
            ensures they match as whole words.


            4. Anchors ''^'' and ''$'' are preserved to match the entire line. If
            partial matching were desired, they could be removed.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''min something imal here''

            - Matches: ''MIN text IMAL text''

            - Does not match: ''minimal''

            - Does not match: ''adminimalist''


            Thus, the improved regex is ''^(?i).*\bmin\b.*\bimal\b.*$'' which means:

            - Case-insensitive matching

            - ''min'' and ''imal'' appear as separate words

            - ''min'' occurs before ''imal''

            matching full lines in many tools or regex engines.


            Step 2: The substring ''oon'' appears somewhere in the line, so ''.*''
            is used before and after ''oon'' to allow any characters (including none)
            surrounding it.


            Step 3: The ''(?i)'' inline flag at the start makes the match case-insensitive,

            letters.

            \ repeated exactly 5 times, each matching zero or more characters that\
            \ are **not** lowercase 'd' or newline, followed by one lowercase 'd'.\

            \ additional 'd's beyond the fifth.\n   - `$` : End of line.\n\n3. **Case\
            \ Sensitivity**\n   - The current regex counts only lowercase 'd'.\n \

            letter ''d'', but it was unclear whether uppercase ''D'' should be considered
            and whether the match is for exactly or at least 5 occurrences. To clarify:


            - This regex matches lines with exactly 5 occurrences of the letter ''d''
            or ''D''.

            - It uses `[dD]` to allow matching both lowercase and uppercase ''d''.

            - Anchors `^` and `$` ensure the match applies to the entire line.

            - The pattern `(?:[^dD]*[dD]){5}` matches exactly 5 occurrences of ''d''
            or ''D'', each potentially preceded by zero or more chars that are not
            ''d'' or ''D''.

            - The trailing `[^dD]*` matches any characters after the last ''d'' or
            ''D'' as long as they don''t include additional ''d'' or ''D'', thus guaranteeing
            exactly 5 matches.


            Assumptions and notes:

            - The input is ASCII or UTF-8 encoded text lines.

            - Case insensitivity only applies to ''d'' and ''D''. If other Unicode
            variants of ''d'' are relevant, the pattern should be adjusted accordingly.


            Example test cases:

            - Match: "ddddd" (five ''d''s)

            - Match: "abcDdDdefD" (5 ''d'' or ''D'' characters)

            - No match: "dddd" (4 ''d''s)

            - No match: "dddddd" (6 ''d''s)

            - No match: "abcde" (1 ''d'')


            This improves on the earlier solution by explicitly handling case insensitivity
            and clarifying the requirement for exactly 5 occurrences.'

            occurrences of the letter ''d'', counting both lowercase ''d'' and uppercase
            ''D''.


            Step-by-step reasoning:


            1. Anchors ^ and $ are used to ensure the entire line is matched.

            2. The regex uses a non-capturing group (?:...) repeated exactly 5 times:
            this group looks for zero or more characters that are not ''d'' or ''D''
            followed by one ''d'' or ''D''. The class [^dD]* ensures that characters
            other than both lowercase and uppercase ''d'' are matched.

            3. After the 5th occurrence of ''d'' or ''D'', zero or more non-''d''
            or non-''D'' characters may appear until the end of the line.

            4. This construction guarantees exactly 5 occurrences of either ''d''
            or ''D'', in any position in the line.


            Examples:

            - Match: "daddD diddE" (contains 5 ''d''s/''D''s)

            - Non-match: "dadd did" (only 4 occurrences)

            - Non-match: "dadddddid" (more than 5 occurrences)


            Note:

            - This pattern assumes ASCII characters. If Unicode, characters resembling
            ''d'' in other scripts won''t be counted.

            - The regex uses standard syntax supported in Python''s `re` module without
            special flags.

            - To handle multiline inputs where each line is tested separately, the
            regex can be used with the `re.MULTILINE` flag and applied line-by-line.'

            sequences of length 5 or more (since it can start inside a longer sequence).

            Step 3: To ensure the sequence is exactly 5 letters, we use lookbehind
            ''(?<![a-zA-Z])'' and lookahead ''(?![a-zA-Z])'' to assert that the 5-letter
            sequence is not immediately preceded or followed by another letter.

            Step 7: Case-insensitive matching can be implied by using the regex in
            a case-insensitive mode (e.g., with the re.I flag in Python).

            - Matches ''abcde'' in ''123 abcde 456'' (exactly 5 letters surrounded

            - Does not match ''abcd'' in ''abcd 123'' (only 4 letters, no match).


            Thus ''(?<![a-zA-Z])[a-zA-Z]{5}(?![a-zA-Z])'' correctly and efficiently

            1. Case Insensitivity: To capture ''der'' in any letter case (e.g., ''Der'',
            ''DER'', ''deR''), I included the inline case-insensitive modifier `(?i)`
            at the start.


            2. Word Boundaries and Word Characters: Using `\b` ensures that matching
            occurs on complete words to avoid substrings inside longer non-word sequences.

            `\w` matches word characters, generally including letters (ASCII), digits,
            and underscore. However, in many modern regex engines (like Python''s
            `re` module with the `re.UNICODE` flag enabled by default), `\w` also
            matches Unicode word characters, covering accented and international letters.
            This helps include words containing ''der'' even if they have accented
            or non-ASCII letters.


            3. Pattern explanation: `\w*der\w*` matches any word containing ''der''
            as a substring, possibly with other word characters before or after it.


            4. Anchors removed: Since the task is to check if the line contains a
            matching word, the anchors `^` and `$` along with `.*` are redundant.
            The pattern alone suffices to search within the line.


            5. Handling Punctuation: The word boundary `\b` correctly differentiates
            words from adjacent punctuation such as periods, commas, or parentheses.
            For instance, it matches ''ender.'' or ''(derivative)'' by excluding punctuation
            from the word characters.

            and ends with ''$''.


            Step 2: We want to find a word containing ''der''. A word is a sequence

            To match such lines fully, anchoring with ''^'' and ''$'' ensures the
            whole line is matched. However, as feedback noted, if the intent is to
            simply find lines containing ''itch'', the substring search ''itch'' alone
            might suffice in some contexts. To cover the case-insensitive matching
            (which is often useful unless specified otherwise), I added the inline
            modifier ''(?i)'' at the start, making the regex match ''itch'' in any
            case (e.g., ''Itch'', ''ITCH''). The pattern then becomes ''^.*itch.*$'',
            meaning: from start ''^'', any characters ''.*'', the substring ''itch''
            (case-insensitive), any characters ''.*'', then end of line ''$''.


            This ensures that any line containing ''itch'' in any case, anywhere in
            the line, will be matched fully. Examples:

            - ''The itch is annoying'' -> match

            - ''ITCH in the air'' -> match

            - ''KITCHEN'' -> matches substring ''itch'', so matches

            - ''no match here'' -> no match


            If matching only the substring without anchoring is preferred, one could
            use ''(?i)itch'' as a simpler pattern, but the given regex fully matches
            the line according to typical uses.'

            This involves using word boundaries ''\b'' around ''itch''. Additionally,

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Clarify the definition of a "word": Here, a "word" is
            defined as a sequence of exactly three alphabetic characters (letters
            A-Z or a-z), excluding digits, underscores, or other characters.


            Step 2: Regex pattern for a 3-letter word: To capture exactly three alphabetic
            letters as a word, use `[a-zA-Z]{3}`, and surround it with word boundaries
            `\b` to ensure it matches whole words only, not parts of longer words.


            Step 3: Pattern construction: Use a positive lookahead `(?=.*\b[a-zA-Z]{3}\b)`
            at the start to assert presence of at least one such word anywhere in
            the line.


            Step 4: Anchors and full line match: Anchor at the start `^` and end `$`,
            matching the entire line with `.*` (any characters).


            Step 5: Case sensitivity: Include both uppercase and lowercase letters
            explicitly to cover all English alphabet letters; the regex is inherently
            case sensitive, matching both.


            Step 6: Examples:

            - "The cat sat." matches because it contains "The", "cat", and "sat".

            - "A 12 345 _foo_" does not match because no 3-letter alphabetic word
            is present ("foo" is surrounded by underscores, so word boundaries won''t
            match inside underscores).

            - "co-op" does not match the 3-letter word since "co" and "op" are 2-letter
            chunks separated by a hyphen.


            Step 7: Notes on Unicode: This regex only matches ASCII letters; if Unicode
            letters are needed, the environment must support Unicode character properties
            (e.g., `\p{L}` in some regex flavors) which Python''s `re` module does
            not natively support. Otherwise, an external module like `regex` can be
            used.


            Step 8: Environment and usage: The regex is Python-compatible and requires
            standard escaping (double backslashes). It matches full lines that contain
            at least one 3-letter alphabetic word as defined above.'

            ''On'', ''ON'', ''on'').


            Step 2: Redefine what constitutes a ''word'' to include letters, digits,
            underscores, apostrophes (''), and hyphens (-). This is achieved by using
            a character class [\w''-] which includes these characters.


            Step 3: Match one or more of these allowed characters preceding ''on''
            to ensure the word ends with ''on''. Thus, [\w''-]+on.


            Step 4: Use word boundaries (\b) at both ends to ensure that the matched
            substring is a whole word ending with ''on''. This avoids partial matches
            inside longer words.


            Step 5: Remove unnecessary ''^.*'' and ''.*$'' anchors, since most regex

            The word boundaries ''\b'' ensure we match whole words only.


            Step 2: Since the line can contain one or more such words separated by

            - One occurrence of the word pattern

            avoid matching tabs, multiple spaces, or trailing spaces at the end.


            Step 4: At least one matching word is required; empty lines or lines with

            `re` module.


            Case Sensitivity: Added `(?i)` at the start for case-insensitive matching,
            so words ending with ''er'', ''Er'', ''ER'', etc. are matched.


            Word Boundaries and Punctuation: Python''s `\b` matches word boundaries
            (transitions between `\w` and `\W`). This structure ensures correct matching
            of words ending with ''er'' even if followed by punctuation such as periods
            or commas. For example, the word ''servicer.'' will be matched because
            `\b` comes after ''r'' which is a word character, and the next character
            ''.'' is non-word, so boundary exists.


            Regex Explanation:

            - `^` and `$` anchor the match to the entire line.

            - `(?=.*\b\w*er\b)` is a positive lookahead ensuring at least one word
            in the line ends with ''er''. The `\w*` matches zero or more word characters
            before ''er''.

            - `.*` matches the rest of the line.


            Examples that will match:

            - "The runner was fast."

            - "She is a good programmer!"

            - "The Servicer works here."


            Examples that will not match:

            - "This is a test."

            - "He runs quickly."


            This regex is robust for Python regex usage and matches entire lines containing
            at least one case-insensitive word with ''er'' at the end, accounting
            properly for punctuation following the word.'

            - Add ^\s* to match zero or more whitespace characters at the beginning
            of the line.


            Step 2: Redefine "word"

            - Replace \w with [a-zA-Z] to restrict words to alphabetic characters
            only, excluding digits and underscores.


            Step 3: Match one or more words starting with ''z'' or ''Z''

            - Use (?:[zZ][a-zA-Z]*\s+)* for zero or more occurrences of a word starting
            with ''z'' followed by one or more whitespace characters.

            - Use [zZ][a-zA-Z]* to match the last word (without mandatory trailing
            whitespace after it).


            Step 4: Handle trailing whitespace

            - Add \s*$ to allow optional trailing whitespace until the end of the
            line.


            Step 5: Confirm full line match

            - The regex matches lines consisting solely of words starting with ''z''
            or ''Z'' (alphabetic only), separated by any whitespace (spaces, tabs,
            etc.), with optional leading and trailing whitespace.

          reasoning: 'Step 1: Understand the requirements clearly.

            - The line must use words that begin with ''z'' (case-insensitive).

            - Words can be separated by any whitespace, including spaces, tabs, or
            multiple spaces.

            - Words may have punctuation immediately following them (e.g., commas,
            periods, semicolons).

            - There''s no explicit instruction to match empty or whitespace-only lines,
            so the regex will only match lines with at least one valid word.


            Step 2: Define what a word is.

            - A word starts with ''z'' or ''Z'' (we use the case-insensitive flag
            `(?i)` to simplify).

            - It is followed by zero or more lowercase alphabetic letters ([a-z]*).

            - It may be immediately followed by an optional punctuation character
            from [.,;:!?

            ].


            Note: We use [a-z] assuming words only contain alphabetic characters after
            the initial ''z'' to exclude digits and underscores.


            Step 3: Handling word separators.

            - Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters (\s+).

            - The line can have leading and trailing whitespace (\s*).


            Step 4: Combine all together.

            - The pattern for one word is: [z][a-z]*[.,;:!?]?

            - For multiple words separated by whitespace: (?:word \s*)+

            - The entire line anchored with ^ and $ to ensure full line match.


            Step 5: Final regex:

            - ^(?i)\s*(?:[z][a-z]*[.,;:!?]?\s*)+$


            This will match lines consisting of one or more words that start with
            ''z'' (case-insensitive), possibly followed by punctuation, separated
            by whitespace. It does not match empty lines.


            Example matches:

            - "Zebra Zebra"

            - "zoo, Zebra."

            - "Zebra  zebra\tzoo!"


            Example non-matches:

            - "apple Zebra"

            - "zebra1"

            - "" (empty line)


            This addresses the feedback points:

            - Uses \s+ to handle multiple spaces or tabs

            - Uses case-insensitive flag for simplicity

            - Allows common punctuation after words

            - Requires at least one word (no empty line matches)

            - Restricts word characters to alphabetic letters

            - Anchors to full line

            Refinements and explanations:


            1. Simplicity and clarity:

            - The regex uses ''^'' and ''$'' to assert start and end of the line.

            - ''.*'' before and after the target word allows any text around it on
            the line.


            2. Word definition:

            - ''\b'' ensures we match whole words considering word boundaries (i.e.,
            positions between word and non-word chars).

            - Using ''[a-z]*'' instead of ''\w*'' to match only alphabetic letters
            before the last character, avoiding digits and underscores.


            3. Case-insensitive matching:

            - Using inline modifier ''(?i)'' at the start so words ending in uppercase
            or lowercase ''Y'' or ''I'' are matched.


            4. Word ending:

            - The word ends with ''[yi]'' meaning ''y'' or ''i''.


            5. Handling edge cases:

            - ''\b'' handles punctuation attached to words (like ''sky.'' or ''hi-fi'')
            effectively, matching words correctly.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''happy day'', ''sky.'', ''Hi-fi'', ''Aluminium is shiny''

            - Does not match: ''hello world'', ''python''


            This pattern is straightforward, efficient, and meets the specification
            with case-insensitive matching and proper word boundaries.

            Improvements based on the feedback:

            1. Simplified the regex to avoid unnecessary grouping and quantifiers
            around the entire pattern: using ''^.*...*$'', which covers the entire
            line.

            2. Applied case-insensitivity with the inline modifier ''(?i)'' at the
            start, which handles uppercase and lowercase endings (''Y'' or ''I'').

            3. Modified the word character pattern inside the word boundary to ''[\w''-]*'',
            allowing letters, digits, underscores, apostrophes, and hyphens in words.
            This better accommodates words like "why," "don''t," or "mother-in-law."

            4. Used ''\b'' word boundaries to ensure matching full words and not partial
            matches.

            5. Ensured that words with trailing punctuation like '','' or ''?'' are
            matched correctly because punctuation is not considered part of ''\w''
            and word boundaries handle this appropriately.


            Overall, this regex will match any line containing at least one word ending

            Initial thoughts might lead to a pattern like `^.*\b[bB]\w*\b.*$`, which
            matches any line containing a word boundary `\b` followed by either ''b''
            or ''B'' and then zero or more word characters `\w*`. However, this includes
            explicitly specifying both ''b'' and ''B'', which is less readable and
            maintainable.


            Improvement:

            - Use the inline case-insensitive flag `(?i)` at the beginning to handle
            both ''b'' and ''B'' uniformly.

            - Use `\b` to denote word boundaries ensuring that the match starts at
            the beginning of a word.

            - Use `\w*` to match the rest of the word characters following ''b''.

            - The pattern `.*` before and after allows any characters, ensuring the
            regex matches the whole line.

            - Anchoring with `^` and `$` ensures the entire line is matched.


            Handling punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters:

            - The `\b` word boundary works well to separate words from punctuation.

            - Words with apostrophes or hyphens would not be fully matched because
            `\w` matches only alphanumeric characters and underscores; for example,
            "b''s" or "be-careful" would partially match. To fully handle such cases,
            the pattern could be expanded, but was not explicitly requested.


            Unicode considerations:

            - By default, `\w` matches ASCII word characters. Using `re.UNICODE` flag
            in Python (which is default in Python 3) extends this to Unicode characters.

            - Inline modifiers like `(?i)` affect case insensitivity but to fully
            support Unicode case folding, more advanced handling may be needed.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "Banana is a fruit.", "The big brown bear."

            - Does not match: "An apple a day.", "Cats and dogs."


            This regex satisfies the requirement by ensuring the entire line is matched

          reasoning: 'The goal is to match lines containing at least one word that
            starts with the letter ''b'' or ''B''. To ensure this:


            1. Case-Insensitive Matching: Using the inline case-insensitive flag `(?i)`,
            the regex matches words starting with both uppercase ''B'' and lowercase
            ''b''.


            2. Word Boundaries: The `\b` meta-character asserts a word boundary, ensuring
            the match starts exactly at the beginning of a word and ends at the word''s
            boundary to avoid partial matches within words.


            3. Word Characters: `b\w*` matches a word starting with ''b'' or ''B''
            followed by zero or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscore).


            4. Efficiency: Anchors `^` and `$` and `.*` are removed because typically,
            regex search functions scan the entire line. This improves efficiency
            and simplicity.


            5. Limitations: Note that `\b` behavior depends on the regex engine and
            its definition of word boundaries, which may vary especially with Unicode
            or non-alphanumeric characters adjacent to words. It is recommended to
            test this regex in the target environment.


            Examples:

            - Matches: "Beach life is fun." (matches "Beach"), "The big brown bear."
            (matches "big", "brown", "bear")

            - Does not match: "I love apples." (no word starting with ''b''), "" (empty
            line)


            This regex will find lines containing at least one word starting with
            ''b'' or ''B'', handling common punctuation cases correctly due to word
            boundaries.'

            \ to ensure the order: 'son' or 'soon' first, then 'su' later on the same\
            \ line.\n\n3. To do this, we use a single positive lookahead: (?=.*(son|soon).*su),\
            \ which means somewhere in the line there is 'son' or 'soon', followed\
            \ by any characters, then 'su'. This ensures the correct order.\n\n4.\

            \ '.*' after the lookahead is necessary because the lookahead does not\
            \ consume characters; it only asserts a pattern exists. Therefore, we\
            \ match the entire line with .* to consume all characters.\n\n7. Regarding\
            \ case sensitivity, the problem does not specify if matching should be\

            \n1. **Matching 'son' or 'soon' as substrings:**\n   The user did not\
            \ specify word boundaries, so we will match these substrings wherever\
            \ they appear in the line.\n\n2. **Ensuring order - 'son' or 'soon' before\

            \ followed somewhere later by 'su'. To enforce this order explicitly within\
            \ the regex requires careful design.\n\n3. **Approach to enforce order:**\n\
            \   - Matching lines with 'son' or 'soon' first and then 'su' later can\
            \ be done by matching from the start of the line:\n     `^.*(son|soon).*su.*$`\n\

            \ `(son|soon)` substring comes before a subsequent `su` substring somewhere\
            \ later in the line.\n\n4. **Case sensitivity:**\n   - The problem doesn't\
            \ explicitly mention case sensitivity, but matching is typically case-insensitive\
            \ for substring searches unless otherwise specified.\n   - We will recommend\
            \ using case-insensitive matching in code with the `re.IGNORECASE` flag.\n\
            \n5. **Consideration of lookahead:**\n   - Lookaheads can locate the substrings\
            \ anywhere in the line, but they do not enforce ordering easily.\n   -\
            \ Using a single regex with proper order is clearer and more maintainable.\n\
            \n6. **Examples and testing:**\n   | Input Line                      \
            \   | Matches? | Reason                          |\n   |----------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------|\n\
            \   | \"this is a son of a soon fish\"  | No       | No 'su' after 'son'\
            \ or 'soon'  |\n   | \"this son understood sushi\"     | Yes      | 'son'\
            \ before 'su' in 'sushi'   |\n   | \"soon the sun will rise\"        |\
            \ Yes      | 'soon' before 'su' in 'sun'    |\n   | \"sushi and son both\
            \ here\"       | No       | 'su' appears before 'son'      |\n   | \"\
            SON finally meets SU\"           | Yes      | Case-insensitive match \
            \        |\n\n7. **Final recommendation:**\n   The regex pattern to use\
            \ is:\n   ```\n   ^.*(son|soon).*su.*$\n   ```\n   - Use with case-insensitive\
            \ matching flag (`re.IGNORECASE` in Python).\n\n**Summary:** This pattern\
            \ matches any line where 'son' or 'soon' appears before 'su' somewhere\
            \ later in the line, with substring matching and case-insensitivity.\n\
            \n**Note:** Since regex greedily matches `(son|soon)` first occurrence,\
            \ it naturally ensures order. Using this approach is simpler and more\

            it''s a practical tradeoff given the requirement.


            Step 5: The regex as currently written is case-sensitive. To handle different
            capitalizations (e.g., ''homer'', ''ODYSSEY''), case-insensitive matching
            should be enabled via the regex engine''s flag (e.g., re.IGNORECASE in

            earliest ''Homer'' and the latest following ''Odyssey''.


            Examples:

            - Matches: ''The epic poem by Homer about the Odyssey.''

            - Matches: ''Homer is known for the Odyssey and other works.''

            - Does not match: ''The Odyssey by Homer is famous.'' (matches anyway
            because ''Homer'' is before ''Odyssey'' in the line)

            - Does not match: ''Odyssey tells a tale before Homer wrote.'' (because
            ''Odyssey'' precedes ''Homer'')


            Usage recommendation in Python:

            ```python

            \ entire lines that contain a substring of exactly three letters starting\
            \ with the letter 'a'.\n- The substring should consist of alphabetic characters\
            \ only.\n- The match should be case-insensitive, so 'a' or 'A' can start\
            \ the substring.\n- The substring can appear anywhere within the line\
            \ and does not need to be a standalone word.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\
            1. To find a 3-letter substring starting with 'a', the substring must\
            \ match:\n   - First character: 'a' or 'A'\n   - Next two characters:\
            \ letters (assumed ASCII letters a-z or A-Z)\n\n2. The substring pattern\
            \ is therefore 'a' followed by two letters.\n   - To express this precisely:\
            \ 'a[a-zA-Z]{2}'\n\n3. Since the problem involves case-insensitivity,\
            \ it is best to add the inline case-insensitive flag '(?i)' at the start\
            \ of the regex.\n   - This allows us to write 'a' without worrying about\
            \ 'A' separately.\n\n4. To match lines containing this substring anywhere:\n\
            \   - Use '.*' before and after the substring pattern to allow any characters\
            \ before or after\n   - Entire regex becomes: '^.*a[a-zA-Z]{2}.*$'\n\n\
            5. Incorporate the case-insensitive flag: '^(?i).*a[a-z]{2}.*$'\n\n6.\
            \ Using '[a-z]' instead of '[a-zA-Z]' because the case-insensitivity flag\
            \ '(?i)' covers both uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n7. This regex\
            \ matches any line that contains a sequence of three letters starting\
            \ with 'a' or 'A'.\n\nExamples:\n- Matches:\n  * \"apple is great\" (contains\
            \ \"app\")\n  * \"An amazing day\" (contains \"Ama\")\n  * \"catapult\"\
            \ (contains \"atu\") does not match because the substring does not start\
            \ with 'a'\n  \n- Non-matches:\n  * \"cat\" (does not contain a substring\
            \ starting with 'a')\n  * \"at\" (substring too short)\n\nNotes:\n- The\
            \ regex assumes ASCII letters only. It does not account for accented or\
            \ Unicode letters.\n- Word boundaries are not enforced as the problem\
            \ does not specify the substring to be a separate word.\n- The regex from\
            \ the original solution '^.*a..$' is insufficient because it anchors the\
            \ substring at the end of the line and does not ensure alphabetic letters.\n\

            Step 2: The substring should be exactly 3 letters long. So after ''a'',
            match exactly two letters: ''[a-z]{2}''. Since the regex is case-insensitive,
            this covers both uppercase and lowercase letters.


            Using this direct substring match approach avoids unnecessary ''^.*''
            or ''.*$'' wrappers, which are not needed if just searching for the substring

            Step 3: To match three consecutive letters, use the pattern [a-zA-Z]{3}
            which means exactly three letters in a row.


            Step 4: Since we want this to appear anywhere in the line, we surround
            it with anchors and wildcards:

            - ''^'' marks the start of the line.

            - ''.*'' matches any number (including zero) of any characters.

            - ''[a-zA-Z]{3}'' matches the required three consecutive letters.

            - ''.*'' again matches any characters following the three letters.

            - ''$'' marks the end of the line.


            Step 5: The full regex is ''^.*[a-zA-Z]{3}.*$'' which matches any line
            that has at least 3 consecutive letters anywhere in it.'

            Step-by-step solution:

            2. We place ''h'' directly after [a-zA-Z] without any space or character

            4. To match the entire line, we start with ''^'' and end with ''$''.

            Step 3: Since these substrings can appear anywhere, use a positive lookahead
            (?=.*(?:ead|pro)) to ensure these substrings exist somewhere in the line.

            Step 5: Use .* after the lookahead to match the entire line content.


            Thus, the final regex is ^(?=.*(?:ead|pro)).*$ which matches any line

            \ words.\n\n1. **Word Definition**: We consider a \"word\" to be a sequence\
            \ of word characters matched by `\\w+`. Note that `\\w` is shorthand for\
            \ [A-Za-z0-9_], which covers ASCII letters, digits, and underscore. This\
            \ excludes Unicode characters (e.g., accented letters). To fully support\
            \ Unicode words, in Python's `re` module you could use `re.UNICODE` (default\
            \ in Python 3) or consider `\\b\\w+\\b` with Unicode properties (not fully\
            \ supported in standard `re`). For now, we'll stick with `\\w+` as a reasonable\
            \ standard.\n\n2. **Separators**: Using `\\s+` (one or more whitespace\
            \ characters) between words is more precise and common for word separation\
            \ instead of `\\W+`, which includes any non-word character (like punctuation).\
            \ This mitigates matching artifacts caused by punctuation attached to\
            \ words.\n\n3. **Matching at least three words**: To match lines with\
            \ at least three words, we need to match three instances of the pattern\
            \ `\\b\\w+\\b` separated by whitespace.\n\n    - The pattern `(?:\\b\\\
            w+\\b\\s+){2,}\\b\\w+\\b` requires at least two occurrences of a \"word\
            \ + spaces\" pattern, followed by one more word.\n    - This means: word\
            \ + (spaces + word) + (spaces + word) for minimum three words.\n\n4. **Anchors\
            \ and full line matching**: The regex is anchored with `^` and `$` to\
            \ ensure the entire line matches. `.*$` is added to allow any characters\
            \ after the third word to complete the line.\n\n5. **Examples**:\n   \
            \ - Matches: \n        - \"This is test\"\n        - \"Hello world here\"\
            \n        - \"One two three four\"\n    - Does not match:\n        - \"\
            Hello\"\n        - \"Two words\"\n        - \"\"\n\n6. **Limitations**:\n\
            \    - Lines with words separated by punctuation instead of spaces will\
            \ not count as multiple words (e.g., \"word1,word2\" counts as one word).\n\
            \    - Unicode words containing accented characters or apostrophes won't\
            \ be fully matched by `\\w+`.\n    - For multiline text, each line should\
            \ be matched separately (e.g., by applying this regex line-by-line or\
            \ using multiline mode `re.MULTILINE`).\n\n7. **Summary**: This regex\
            \ efficiently ensures at least three whitespace-separated words per line,\

          reasoning: 'To refine the regex and address the feedback:


            1. Use word boundaries (\b) around ''sec'' and ''mun'' to ensure these
            are matched as whole words only, preventing partial matches inside other
            words (e.g., ''second'' or ''immune''). This avoids unintended matches.


            2. Use a non-greedy quantifier ''.*?'' between ''sec'' and ''mun'' to
            match the minimal characters between these two words. This helps with
            performance and reduces overmatching.


            3. Remove ''^'' and ''$'' anchors to avoid forcing the regex to match
            the entire line. Instead, the regex checks for the existence of ''sec''
            before ''mun'' anywhere within the line.


            Examples to illustrate the behavior:

            - Matches: ''The sec will meet mun today'' (sec before mun as whole words)

            - Does not match: ''The second meeting is immune'' (sec and mun as substrings
            of larger words, not standalone)

            - Matches: ''sec something mun'' (minimal match between words due to non-greedy
            quantifier)

            - Matches: ''sec ... sec ... mun ... mun'' (finds the first ''sec'' followed
            by any ''mun'')


            Thus, the regex ''\bsec\b.*?\bmun\b'' accurately enforces the condition
            that ''sec'' appears as a standalone word before ''mun'' as a standalone
            word in the line.'

            The pattern ''^.*\bsec\b.*\bmun\b.*$'' ensures the line contains the word
            ''sec'' somewhere before the word ''mun''.


            Step 2: Use word boundaries ''\b'' around ''sec'' and ''mun'' to match
            whole words only, avoiding partial matches like ''secremun'' or ''secmun''.
            This improves precision.


            Step 3: The ''.*'' before, between, and after the words allows any characters,
            ensuring the order is ''sec'' before ''mun''.


            Step 4: Overlapping occurrences like ''secmun'' will not match because
            ''sec'' and ''mun'' are not separated by word boundaries there.


            Step 5: This pattern is efficient enough for typical lines: it matches
            full lines containing the word ''sec'' followed later by the word ''mun''.


            Step 6: Edge cases: lines with ''mun'' before ''sec'' do not match; lines

            explicitly desired. This can be adjusted depending on whether a single-letter

            3. Added the inline ''(?i)'' modifier at the start to make matching case-insensitive,

            4. Maintained use of ''\b'' (word boundaries) to ensure whole-word matching,
            noting that some regex engines may need Unicode-aware boundaries for full
            Unicode support.


            Potential limitations:

            - The regex assumes ''\w'' matches word characters as intended; in some
            engines, this might not include all Unicode word characters.

            - The ''\b'' word boundary may not fully handle Unicode word boundaries
            without specific support.


            Example test cases:

            - Matches: "Can", "sun", "moon", "N", "London"

            - Does not match: "cat", "runny", "banana"


            Overall, this regex balances usability and efficiency for typical English
            text and common regex engines.'

            Improvements based on feedback:

            - Removed unnecessary ''^'' and ''$'' anchors and leading/trailing ''.*''
            since the goal is to find occurrences anywhere in the line, not necessarily
            match the whole line.

            - Used ''\bTriple\b'' and ''\bX\w*\b'' to ensure matching entire words
            and prevent partial word matches.

            - ''\s+'' ensures direct adjacency by whitespace between ''Triple'' and
            the ''X''-word.

            - This regex does not allow punctuation directly between ''Triple'' and
            the ''X'' word because the requirement specifies direct following by words
            (whitespace-separated).


            Example test cases:

            3. Used a case-sensitive match as the user did not specify case insensitivity;
            this can be changed by adding inline modifiers if needed.

            4. Modified the whitespace match to [ ]+ (spaces only) instead of \s+
            to exclude newlines and tabs, because newlines would break the line and
            tabs might be less appropriate. Assuming ''directly followed by'' means
            words separated by spaces only.

            5. The ''X'' word now uses X\S* which matches ''X'' followed by zero or

            6. Pattern is anchored with ^ and $ to match entire line, as usually line
